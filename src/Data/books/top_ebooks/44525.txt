EDITORIAL NOTES.


The Report on the RADIOLARIA by Professor Ernst Haeckel of Jena occupies
the whole of the present Volume, the text being bound up in Two Separate
Parts and the Plates in a Third Part. The Report forms Part XL. of the
Zoological Series of Reports on the Scientific Results of the Expedition,
and is the largest single Report of the series which has up to this time
been published.

The Manuscript of the Systematic Part was written by Professor Haeckel in
the English language, and was received by me in instalments on the 12th
August 1884, 13th July and 4th December 1885, and 3rd June 1886. The
Introduction was written in German and was translated into the English
language by Mr. W. E. Hoyle of the Challenger Editorial Staff; the German
text being received in instalments between the 15th July 1886, and the 25th
January 1887.

The Challenger Naturalists found the representatives of this group of
animals to be universally distributed throughout ocean waters, and their
dead remains to be nearly equally widely distributed over the floor of the
ocean, the relative abundance and the species differing, however, with
change of locality, and their abundance or variety being intimately
connected with some of the most interesting and intricate problems of
general oceanography.

It was a fortunate circumstance that so distinguished a Naturalist, with
such an intimate knowledge of the RADIOLARIA, should have been willing to
undertake the laborious examination and description of the extensive
collections made during the Expedition. Professor Haeckel has devoted ten
years of his life to this work, and this Report sets forth the results of
his labours, on the conclusion of which he will be congratulated by all
Naturalists. The entire literature of the RADIOLARIA (from 1834 to 1884) is
completely recorded, and the older species (both living and fossil)
redescribed, so that the Report is a complete Monograph, which will be an
invaluable aid to all future Investigators.

  Report on the RADIOLARIA collected by H.M.S. Challenger during the Years
  1873-76. By ERNST HAECKEL, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Zoology in the

PREFACE.


The significance of the Radiolaria in regard to the relations of life in
the ocean has been increased in a most unexpected manner by the discoveries
of the Challenger. Large swarms of these delicate Rhizopoda were found not
only at the surface of the open ocean but also in its different
bathymetrical zones. Thousands of new species make up the wonderful
Radiolarian ooze, which covers large areas of the deep-sea bed, and was
brought up from abysses of from 2000 to 4000 fathoms by the sounding
machine of the Challenger. They open a new world to morphological
investigation.

When ten years ago (in the autumn of 1876) I accepted the enticing
invitation of Sir Wyville Thomson to undertake the investigation of these
microscopic creatures, I hoped to be able to accomplish the task with some
degree of completeness within a period of from three to five years, but the
further my investigations proceeded the more immeasurable seemed the range
of forms, like the boundless firmament of stars. I soon found myself
compelled to decide between making a detailed study of a selection of
special forms or giving as complete a survey as possible of the varied
forms of the whole class; and I decided upon the latter course, having
regard both to the general plan of the Challenger Reports, and to the
interests of our acquaintance with the class as a whole. I must, however,
confess at the close of my work that my original intention is far from
having been fulfilled. The extraordinary extent and varied difficulties of
the undertaking must excuse the many deficiencies.

The special examination of the Challenger collection was for the most part
completed in the summer of 1881; I collected its results in my Entwurf
eines Radiolarien-Systems auf Grund von Studien der Challenger-Radiolarien
(Jenaische Zeitschr. f. Naturw., Bd. xv., 1881). Since the manuscript of
this preliminary communication was completed only a few days before my
departure for Ceylon, and since I was unable to correct the proofs myself,
several errors have crept into the Prodromus Systematis Radiolarium
included in it. These have been corrected in the following more extensive
working out of it. Even at that time I had distinguished 630 genera and
more than 2000 species; but on the revision of these, which I undertook
immediately on my return from India, this number was considerably
increased. The total number of forms here described amounts to 739 genera
and 4318 species; of these 3508 are new, as against 810 previously
described. In spite of this large number, however, and in spite of the
astonishing variety of the new and marvellous forms, the riches of the
Challenger collection are by no means exhausted. A careful and patient
worker who would devote a second decade to the work, would probably
increase the number of new forms (especially of the smaller ones) by more
than a thousand; but for a really complete examination, the lifetime of one
man would not suffice.

The richest source of the Challenger material is the Radiolarian ooze of
the central Pacific Ocean (Stations 265 to 274). This remarkable deep-sea
mud consists for the greater part of well-preserved siliceous shells of
Polycystina (SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA). Not less important, however,
especially for the study of the ACANTHARIA and PHÆODARIA, are the wonderful
preparations stained with carmine and mounted in Canada balsam on the spot
by Dr. John Murray. One such preparation (_e.g._, from Station 271) often
contains twenty or thirty, sometimes even fifty new species. In many of
these preparations the individual parts of the unicellular organism are so
well preserved that they show clearly the characteristic peculiarities of
the legions and orders. Since the material for these preparations was taken
with the tow-net, not only from the surface of the sea but also from
different bathymetrical zones, it furnishes valuable conclusions regarding
the chorology, as well as the physiology and morphology of the group. For
many new discoveries I am indebted to the study of such preparations, of
which I have examined about a thousand from 168 different Stations (compare
§ 240). In addition to these about 100 bottles were handed to me,
containing partly bottom-deposits, partly tow-net gatherings.

Sir Wyville Thomson, who directed the investigations of the Challenger with
so much devotion, and only partly saw its results, has laid me under a deep
debt of obligation; not less is this the case, however, with his successor,
Dr. John Murray. I am especially indebted to both gentlemen for the freedom
they have allowed me in the carrying out of my work, and especially for the
permission to include a description of all known Radiolaria in the
Challenger Report, which has thus become a second edition many times
enlarged of my Monograph published in 1862. Since all previous literature
of the subject has been consulted and critically revised, it is hoped that
this Report will form a useful foundation for future investigations. All
names of sufficiently described Radiolaria published during the first half
century of our knowledge of the class (from 1834 to 1884), are inserted in
alphabetical order in the index at the end of this work.

In addition to the treasures of the Challenger, my own collection of
Radiolaria has yielded many new forms whose description is here included.
On my journeys to the Mediterranean (an account of which is given in the
introduction to my Monograph of the Medusæ), I have given special attention
to these delicate microscopic organisms for more than thirty years. Besides
the various points on the Mediterranean, the Atlantic Ocean at the Canaries
(in the winter of 1866-67) yielded many interesting new forms; whilst my
voyage across the Indian Ocean, from Aden to Bombay, in November 1881,
thence to Ceylon and back by Socotra in March 1882, was still more
productive. In particular, some extended excursions which I had the
opportunity of making from Belligemma and Matura (at the southern extremity
of Ceylon) gave me an insight into the rich treasures of the Indian Ocean.

Most important, however, as regards the knowledge of the Indian Radiolaria,
are the collections which Captain Heinrich Rabbe of Bremen has so
beautifully preserved during his many voyages through that region. In the
neighbourhood of Madagascar and the Cocos Islands more especially, and also
in the Sunda Archipelago, he met with large swarms of Radiolaria, among
which were many new and remarkable forms. These were of special value for
completing the chorology, and the more so since the course of the
Challenger in the Indian Ocean lay very far to the southwards. I will
therefore take this opportunity of repeating my best thanks to Captain
Rabbe for the friendly donation of his valuable collection.

The Radiolarian fauna of the North Atlantic Ocean, which was previously but
little known and only slightly increased by the investigations of the
Challenger, received a valuable increase from the interesting collections
made by Dr. John Murray on various expeditions to the Færöe Islands (on the
"Knight Errant" in 1880 and on the "Triton" in 1882). A large number of new
Radiolaria were captured in the Færöe Channel, partly at the surface of the
Gulf Stream, partly at various depths, and the proof was thus furnished
that at certain points in the North Atlantic Ocean Radiolaria are very
richly developed. I am further indebted to Dr. John Murray for the free use
of this important material as well as for much other assistance in the
carrying out of my work. Another rich source of Radiolaria I found in the
alimentary canal of pelagic animals from all seas. Medusæ, Siphonophoræ,
Salpæ, Pteropoda, Heteropoda, Crustacea, &c., which live partly at the
surface of the sea and partly at various depths, and swallow large masses
of Radiolaria, often contain numbers of their shells well-preserved in
their intestine. The alimentary canal of Fishes and Cephalopods too, which
live upon these pelagic animal frequently contains considerable quantities
of siliceous shells; and another newly discovered source has been found in
the coprolites of the Jurassic period, which consist largely of Radiolarian
skeletons.

In the investigation of this complicated system of organisms, I have
endeavoured on the one hand to give accurately the forms and dimensions of
the species observed, and on the other hand to present a survey of the
relationships of the different genera and families; and in this I have
striven especially to combine the phylogenetic aims of the natural system
with the essentially artificial divisions of a practical classification.
Being, however, a conscientious supporter of the theory of descent, I can
of course lay no stress upon the value of the categories, which are here
distinguished as Legions, Orders, Families, Genera, &c. All these
artificial systematic grades I regard as of merely relative value; and from
the same cause I attach no importance to the distinction of all the species
here described; many of them are probably only developmental stages, and
like my predecessors I have determined their boundaries on subjective
grounds. In the systematic working out of so much material one always runs
the risk of doing either too much or too little in the way of creating
species; but in the light of the theory of descent this danger is of no
consequence.

In the carrying out of this extensive task the friendly aid of Dr. Reinhold
Teuscher of Jena was of the greatest benefit to me; at my request he was at
the trouble of making a large number of accurate drawings with the camera
lucida, and he also undertook a long series, amounting to some 8000,
accurate micrometric measurements, which were of the greatest value in the
attempt to settle the important question of the constancy of the various
species; I have alluded to this in a note at the conclusion of the Report
(p. 1760). My best thanks are due to Dr. Teuscher for the patient and
careful manner in which he discharged these tedious tasks.

The figures of new species of Radiolaria (about 1600 in number) which
appear in the atlas of one hundred and forty plates accompanying this
Report, were nearly all drawn with the camera lucida, partly by Mr. Adolph
Giltsch and partly by myself. The names of the genera which appear at the
bottom of the plates have in many cases been changed since they were
printed off, as may be seen from the explanations which accompany them. Had
it been possible to complete the examination of the material before the
plates were commenced this might have been avoided, and in many cases a
better selection of figures might have been made. All the drawings have
been made upon the stone by the practised hand of Mr. Adolph Giltsch, in
his usual masterly manner, and his lithographic work, which has lasted
fully ten years, is the more valuable since he has himself microscopically
studied the greater part of the species figured. The fact that the atlas
presents so full a picture of the marvellous wealth of form of the
Radiolaria is especially due to his lively interest in the work, to his
unwearying care, and to his morphological acuteness. May it be the means of
inducing many naturalists to study more deeply this inexhaustible kingdom
of microscopic life, whose endless variety of wonderful forms justifies the
saying--_Natura in minimis maxima_.

A SKETCH OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORGANISATION OF THE RADIOLARIA IN THE YEAR
1884.


----


CHAPTER I.--THE UNICELLULAR ORGANISM.

(§§ 1-50.)

1. _Definition of the Radiolaria._--RADIOLARIA are marine Rhizopoda, whose
unicellular body always consists of two main portions, separated by a
membrane; an inner _Central capsule_ (with one or more nuclei) and an
_Extracapsulum_ (the external calymma, which has no nucleus, and the
pseudopodia); the endoplasm of the former and the exoplasm of the latter
are connected by openings in the capsule-membrane. The central capsule is
partly the general central organ of the Radiolarian cell, partly the
special organ of reproduction, since its intracapsular protoplasm, along
with the nuclei embedded in it, serves for the formation of flagellate
spores. The extracapsulum is partly the general organ for intercourse with
the outer world (by means of the pseudopodia), partly the special organ of
protection (calymma) and nutrition (sarcomatrix). The majority of
Radiolaria develop also a skeleton for support and protection, which
presents the utmost variety of form, and is generally composed of silica,
sometimes of an organic substance (acanthin). The Radiolarian cell usually
leads an isolated existence (Monozoa _vel_ Monocyttaria); only in a small
minority (of one legion) are the unicellular organisms united in colonies
or coenobia (Polyzoa _vel_ Polycyttaria).

  The extent of the Radiolaria, as limited by the above definition, which I
  have made as compact as possible, differs in several important respects
  from that allowed to the group by all previous diagnoses. The shortest
  expression of its scope might perhaps be:--Rhizopoda with central capsule
  and calymma; for the most important character of the Radiolaria, and that
  by which they are distinguished from all other Rhizopoda, is the
  differentiation of the unicellular body into two principal parts of equal
  importance and their separation by a constant capsule-membrane.


2. _The Two Subclasses of the Radiolaria._--The systematic catalogue of the
Radiolaria, which forms the second part of this Report, and is brought up
to the year {ii}1884, contains 20 orders, 85 families, 739 genera, and 4318
species. The consideration that but a small proportion of the ocean his yet
been investigated renders it likely, however, that even this large number
does not include the half of the recent species. The great progress which
our knowledge of the organisation of the Radiolaria has made, by means of
comparative study, renders it possible to arrange this enormous mass of
forms in four main divisions or legions, and these are again related in
pairs, so that two divisions of the highest rank or subclasses are
constituted, the _Porulosa_ (or _Holotrypasta_) and _Osculosa_ (or
_Merotrypasta_).

  The division of the Radiolaria into two subclasses and four legions (or
  principal orders), I sought to establish in 1883 in a communication on
  the Orders of the Radiolaria (Sitzb. Jena Gesellsch. Med. u. Naturwiss.,
  February 16, 1883). As a believer in the theory of descent, I regard all
  the systematic arrangements of specialists as artificial, and all their
  divisions as subjective abstractions, and hence I shall be guided in the
  establishment of such groups as subclasses, legions, orders, &c., by
  purely practical considerations, especially by the desire to give as
  ready a survey as possible of the complex multitude of forms (compare §§
  154 to 156).


3. _Porulosa or Holotrypasta._--The subclass Porulosa or Holotrypasta
includes the two legions, PERIPYLEA or SPUMELLARIA, and ACTIPYLEA or
ACANTHARIA, which agree in the following constant and important
characters:--(1) The _Central Capsule_ is primitively a sphere, and retains
this homaxon form in the majority of the species. (2) The _Membrane_ of the
central capsule is everywhere perforated by very numerous minute pores, but
possesses no larger principal aperture (osculum). (3) The _Pseudopodia_
radiate in all directions and in great numbers from the central capsule,
passing through its pores. (4) The _Equilibrium_ of the floating
unicellular body is in most Porulosa pantostatic (indifferent) or
polystatic (plural-stable), since a vertical axis is either absent, or, if
present, has its two poles similarly constituted. (5) The _Ground-forms_ of
the skeleton are therefore almost always either spherotypic or
isopolar-monaxon, very rarely zygotypic. The two legions of the Porulosa
are distinguished mainly by the skeleton of the SPUMELLARIA (or PERIPYLEA)
being siliceous, never centrogenous, nor composed of acanthin, whilst in
the ACANTHARIA (or ACTIPYLEA) it is always centrogenous and made up of
acanthin; hence in the former the nucleus is always central, in the latter
always excentric.


4. _Osculosa or Merotrypasta._--The subclass Osculosa or Merotrypasta
includes the two legions MONOPYLEA or NASSELLARIA, and CANNOPYLEA or
PHÆODARIA, which agree in the following constant and important
characters:--(1) The Central Capsule is originally monaxon (ovoid or
spheroidal) and retains this ground-form in most of the species. (2) The
_Membrane_ of the central capsule possesses a single large principal
aperture (osculum) at the basal pole of the vertical main axis. (3) The
_Pseudopodia_ radiate from a stream of sarcode which passes out from the
central capsule only on one side, namely, through the principal aperture.
(4) The _Equilibrium_ of the floating body is {iii}monostatic or unistable,
since the two poles of the principal axis are always more or less different
from each other. (5) The _Ground-forms_ of the skeleton are, therefore, for
the most part grammotypic (centraxon) or zygotypic (centroplan), rarely
spherotypic. The two legions of the Osculosa are distinguished chiefly by
the principal opening (osculum) being closed by a porous plate (porochora
with its podoconus) in the NASSELLARIA (or MONOPYLEA), and by a radiate
cover (operculum with its astropyle) in the PHÆODARIA (or CANNOPYLEA).


5. _The four Legions of Radiolaria._--The four principal groups of
Radiolaria, to which we have given the name "legions," are natural units,
since the most important peculiarities in the structure of the central
capsule are quite constant within the limits of the same legion, and since
all the forms in the same legion may be traced without violence to the same
phylogenetic stem. The four legions are, however, related to each other, in
so far as they all exhibit those characters which distinguish the
Radiolaria from other Protista. The two which compose the Porulosa (§ 3)
seem somewhat more nearly related to each other than to the two which make
up the Osculosa (§ 4). When, however, the attempt is made to bring them all
into a phylogenetic relationship, it undoubtedly appears that the
SPUMELLARIA (or PERIPYLEA) are the primitive stem, out of which the other
three have been developed as independent branches. All three have been
derived, probably independently, from the most ancient stem-form of the
SPUMELLARIA, the spherical _Actissa_.


6. _Peripylea or Spumellaria._--Those Radiolaria which we call "PERIPYLEA"
on account of the constitution of their central capsule, or "SPUMELLARIA"
on account of the nature of their skeleton, are separated from the other
three legions of the class by the combination of the following constant
characters:--(1) The _Membrane_ of the central capsule is single and evenly
perforated all over by innumerable fine pore-canals, but without any larger
principal opening (osculum). (2) The _Nucleus_ always lies centrally in the
SPUMELLARIA monozoa and is serotinous, for it divides only at a later
period into the nuclei of the spores; in the SPUMELLARIA polyzoa it is
precocious, and divides early into many small nuclei. (3) The _Pseudopodia_
are exceedingly numerous and distributed evenly over the whole surface of
the central capsule. (4) The _Calymma_ contains no phæodium. (5) The
_Skeleton_ is seldom wanting, is never centrogenous, and is always
siliceous. (6) The _Ground-form_ of the central capsule is originally
spherical (often modified); that of the skeleton is also spherical or, in
the majority of cases, derived in different ways from the sphere.


7. _Actipylea or Acantharia._--These Radiolaria which we call "ACTIPYLEA"
on account of the constitution of their central capsule, or "ACANTHARIA"
from the formation of their skeleton, are separated from the other three
legions by the combination of the following constant characters:--(1) The
_Membrane_ of the central capsule is single and {iv}perforated by numerous
fine pore-canals, which are regularly distributed in series or groups, but
without a larger principal opening (osculum). (2) The _Nucleus_ is always
excentric and generally precocious, since it divides early by a peculiar
process of budding into numerous small nuclei. (3) The _Pseudopodia_ are
very numerous and distributed regularly in groups (or series united into a
network). (4) The _Calymma_ contains no phæodium. (5) The _Skeleton_ is
generally present, always centrogenous, and composed of acanthin. (6) The
_Ground-form_ of the central capsule is originally spherical (often
modified), that of the skeleton polyaxon (often modified).


8. _Monopylea or Nassellaria._--Those Radiolaria which we call "MONOPYLEA"
from the formation of their central capsule, or "NASSELLARIA" from the
nature of their skeleton, are distinguished from the other three legions of
the class by the combination of the following constant characters:--(1) The
_Membrane_ of the central capsule is single, and has only one large
principal opening (osculum) at the basal pole of the vertical main axis;
this osculum is closed by a perforated lid (porochora or operculum porosum)
from which there arises within the central capsule a peculiar cone of
threads or pseudopodia (podoconus). (2) The _Nucleus_ is usually excentric
and is always serotinous, since it only divides at a comparatively late
period into spore-nuclei. (3) The _Pseudopodia_ are not very numerous and
arise by division of a single stem or bundle of threads of sarcode, which
issues from the porochora. (4) The _Calymma_ contains no phæodium. (5) The
_Skeleton_ (very rarely absent) is never centrogenous, but always
extracapsular and siliceous. (6) The _Ground-form_ of the central capsule
is always monaxon (with a vertical allopolar main axis), originally ovoid,
often modified; that of the skeleton is also generally monaxon, often
modified (triradial or bilateral).


9. _Cannopylea or Phæodaria._--Those Radiolaria which we call "CANNOPYLEA"
from the constitution of their central capsule, or "PHÆODARIA" on account
of their peculiar phæodium, are distinguished from the other three legions
by the combination of the following characters:--(1) The _Membrane_ of the
central capsule is double, consisting of a strong outer and delicate inner
capsule, and has only one principal opening (osculum) at the basal pole of
the vertical main axis; this osculum is closed by a radiate cover
(astropyle or operculum radiatum), from the centre of which arises an
external tubular spout (proboscis). Occasionally a few small accessory
openings (parapylæ) are present besides the principal opening. (2) The
_Nucleus_ lies centrally or subcentrally in the capsule (in the vertical
main axis), and is serotinous, inasmuch as it only divides at a late period
into spore-nuclei. (3) The _Pseudopodia_ are usually very numerous and
arise from a thick sarcomatrix, formed by the spreading out of a thick stem
of sarcode, which issues from the astropyle. (4) The _Calymma_ always
contains a phæodium or peculiar voluminous excentric mass of pigment. (5)
The _Skeleton_ (very rarely absent) is never centrogenous, always
extracapsular and formed of a silicate of carbon. (6) The {v}_Ground-form_
of the central capsule is always monaxon (with a vertical allopolar main
axis) and generally spheroidal; that of the skeleton is very varied.

11. _Individuality of the Radiolaria._--Like other Protozoa the Radiolaria
are unicellular organisms, the whole fully developed organisation of which
falls under the category of a single cell, both morphologically and
physiologically. Since this view is based upon the composition of the
individual body out of two different morphological elements, nucleus and
protoplasm, it is at once justified in the case of the majority of
Radiolaria, in which the plasmatic body encloses only a single nucleus (the
so-called "Binnen-Bläschen"); such is the case in all the SPUMELLARIA
monozoa, NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA. This aspect of the case might appear
doubtful in those Radiolaria in which the simple primary cell-nucleus
divides early into numerous small secondary nuclei, as is the case in the
SPUMELLARIA polyzoa and most ACANTHARIA. Strictly speaking, the
multinucleate central capsule should in such cases be regarded as a
syncytium; but since the individual unity of the unicellular organism is as
clearly defined in these precocious multinuclear Radiolaria as in the
ordinary serotinous forms, the former must be considered unicellular
Rhizopods just as are the latter. This mode of regarding {vi}the case is
the more necessary, inasmuch as the early division of the nucleus has no
further influence upon the organisation. Just as in many other classes of
the Protista there are monozootic (solitary) and polyzootic (social) forms,
so also in the Radiolaria there are in addition to the ordinary monozootic
or monobious forms certain families in which colonies or coenobia are
formed by the association of individuals; this distinction may be expressed
by the terms "Monocyttaria" and "Polycyttaria."

  The unicellular nature of the Radiolaria was first established by Richard
  Hertwig in 1879 (L. N. 33),[1] and brought into conformity with our
  present histiological knowledge and the new reform of the cell-theory.
  Huxley, however, who was in 1851 the first to examine living Radiolaria
  accurately, declared _Thalassicolla nucleata_ to be a unicellular
  Protozoon, and the individual central capsules of _Sphærozoum punctatum_
  to be cells, but, owing to the then condition of the cell-theory, he was
  unable to give a conclusive demonstration of this view. Later, when
  Johannes Müller in 1858 and myself in 1862 recognised the peculiar
  "yellow cells" which occur in large numbers in many Radiolaria as true
  nucleated cells, it appeared impossible any longer to maintain the
  unicellular nature of the Radiolaria; also the great complication which I
  showed to exist in the structure of _Thalassicolla_ appeared to
  contradict it. Only after Cienkowski (1871) and Brandt (1881) had shown
  that the "yellow cells" do not belong to the Radiolarian organism, but
  are symbiotic unicellular algæ, was it possible to revive and demonstrate
  anew the unicellular nature of the Radiolaria.


12. _Morphological Individuality._--From the morphological standpoint the
individuality of the unicellular elementary organism is obvious in the
ordinary solitary Radiolaria (Monobia), and is to be so regarded that the
whole body with all its constituent parts, and not merely the central
capsule, is to be regarded as _a cell_. Naturally the xanthellæ or yellow
cells (§§ 76, 90), which as independent algæ live in symbiosis with many
Radiolaria, must be excluded. The unicellular organisation of the
Radiolaria is further to be distinguished from that of the other Protista,
inasmuch as an internal membrane (capsule-membrane) separates the central
(medullary) from the peripheral (cortical) portion. In the coenobia of the
social Radiolaria (or Polycyttaria), the morphological individuality
persists only as regards the medullary portions of the aggregated cells
(the individual central capsules), while the cortical portions fuse
completely to form a common extracapsulum. Hence in these SPUMELLARIA
polyzoa two different stages of morphological individuality must be
distinguished, the _Cell_ as a _Morphon of the first stage_, and the
_Coenobium_ as a _Morphon of the second stage_.


13. _Physiological Individuality._--From the physiological standpoint also
the individuality of the unicellular organism is immediately obvious in the
case of the ordinary solitary Radiolaria (Monobia); as in other Protista it
fulfils all the functions of life by itself alone. This physiological
individuality of the monobious Radiolarian cell is furthermore not
influenced by the xanthellæ, which live as independent algæ in symbiosis
with many Radiolaria; even though these often by the production of starch
assist in the {vii}nourishment of the Radiolaria, yet they are by no means
indispensable to them. On the other hand, the physiological individuality
offers more complicated relations in the social Radiolaria (Polycyttaria)
which live united in colonies or coenobia. Here the actual _Bion_ (or the
fully developed physiological individual) is not represented by the
individual cells, but by the whole multicellular coenobium, which in each
species has a definite form and size. In these coenobia, which are usually
spherical or cylindrical jelly-like masses, several millimeters in
diameter, numerous cells are so intimately united that only their medullary
portions (the central capsule with the endoplasm) remain independent; the
cortical portions (calymma and exoplasm) on the contrary uniting into a
common extracapsulum. This discharges, as a whole, the functions of
locomotion, sensation, and inception of nutriment, while the separate
central capsules act in the main only as reproductive organs (forming
spores) and partly also as the central organs of metastasis (digestion).
Each coenobium may also be regarded as a polycyttarium, _i.e._, a
"multicellular Radiolarian," whose numerous central capsules represent so
many sporangia or spore-capsules.

  On this head compare the section in my monograph of 1862 (L. N. 16),
  entitled Die Organisation der Radiolarien-Colonien; _Polyzoen_ oder
  _Polycyttarien?_ (pp. 116 to 126); and also R. Hertwig, Zur Histologie
  der Radiolarien, 1876 (L. N. 26, p. 23).


14. _Monocyttaria_ and _Polycyttaria_.--In the majority of the Radiolaria
each unicellular organism passes its individual life in an isolated
condition (as a Monocyttarium). Only in a part of the SPUMELLARIA numerous
unicellular individuals are united into societies which are regarded as
coenobia or colonies (Polycyttaria). This is the case in three different
families belonging to the PERIPYLEA, in the Collozoida (without a skeleton,
Pl. 3), the Sphærozoida (with a Beloid skeleton, Pl. 4), and the
Collosphærida (with a Sphæroid skeleton, Pls. 5-8). All three families of
Polycyttaria (or social Radiolaria), agree in their mode of forming
colonies, since the central capsules of the social individuals remain
separate and lie in a common jelly-like mass, which is formed by the fusion
of their extracapsulum. The chief part of the voluminous colonies, which
attain a diameter of several millimetres (sometimes more than 1 cm.), and
are generally spherical, ellipsoidal or cylindrical, consists therefore of
the jelly-like calymma, and this is penetrated by a sarcoplegma, to whose
meshes all the individual organisms contribute by means of the pseudopodia,
which radiate from their sarcomatrix. A further peculiarity in which the
social SPUMELLARIA differ from the solitary consists in the fact that the
former are precocious and the latter serotinous in the division of the
nucleus (§ 64). Whilst in the solitary or monozootic SPUMELLARIA the middle
of the central capsule is occupied by the simple nucleus, and this divides
only at a late period (immediately before the formation of spores) into the
numerous spore nuclei, in the colonial or polyzootic SPUMELLARIA this
division takes place very early, and the middle of each central capsule is
usually occupied by an oil-globule.

  {viii}The colonial Radiolaria were described as early as the year 1834 by
  Meyen, the first investigator of the class, under the name _Sphærozoum_,
  and, as _Palmellaria_, compared with the gelatinous colonies of the
  Nostochineæ. The first accurate observations upon their structure were,
  however, made in 1851 by Huxley, who described examples of all three
  families under the name _Thalassicolla punctata_.  More extended,
  however, were the investigations of Johannes Müller, who in his
  fundamental work (1858) divided the whole class Radiolaria into
  _Solitaria_ and _Polyzoa_.  The _Radiolaria solitaria_ he divided into
  Thalassicolla, Polycystina and Acanthometra, the _Radiolaria polyzoa_
  into Sphærozoa (without a shell) and Collosphæra (with a shell).  The
  most accurate delineation of the Polycyttaria was given by Hertwig in his
  beautiful memoir, Zur Histologie der Radiolarien (1876). Quite recently,
  however (1886), since the completion of my manuscript upon the Challenger
  Radiolaria, a very complete Monograph of the Polycyttaria has appeared by
  Karl Brandt, Die colonie-bildenden Radiolarien (Sphærozoen) des Golfes
  von Neapel und der angrenzenden Meeres-Abschnitte (276 pp., 8 pls.,
  Berlin).  It contains in particular most valuable contributions to the
  physiology and histology.


15. _The Central Capsule and Extracapsulum._--The special peculiarity of
the unicellular Radiolarian organism, by which it is clearly distinguished
from all other Rhizopoda (and indeed from most other Protista), is its
differentiation into two separate chief constituents, the central capsule
and extracapsulum, and the formation of a special membrane which separates
them. This, the capsule-membrane, is not to be compared with an ordinary
cell-membrane, as an external layer, but rather to be regarded as an
internal differentiated product. The extracapsulum or external (cortical)
portion of the body is in most Radiolaria more voluminous than the central
capsule or inner (medullary) portion. The exoplasm of the former (the
cortical or extracapsular protoplasm) is emphatically different from the
endoplasm of the latter (the medullary or intracapsular protoplasm).
Besides the most important vital processes are distributed by division of
labour so completely between them that they appear most distinctly
co-ordinated. The central capsule is on the one hand the general central
organ of the "cell-soul" for the discharge of its sensory and motor
functions (comparable to a ganglion-cell), on the other hand the special
organ of reproduction (sporangium). The extracapsulum, also, is not less
significant, since on the one hand its calymma acts as a protecting
envelope to the central capsule, as a support to the pseudopodia, and a
foundation for the skeleton or a matrix for the development of the shell,
and on the other hand its pseudopodia are of the utmost importance as
peripheral organs of movement and sensation as well as of nutrition and
respiration. The _central capsule_ and the _extracapsulum_ are therefore to
be regarded both morphologically and physiologically as the two
_characteristic co-ordinated principal parts_ of the unicellular
Radiolarian organism.

  In most of the more modern delineations of the Radiolaria the central
  capsule is regarded as the "cell proper" and its membrane as the
  "cell-wall." The following facts are opposed to the correctness of this
  interpretation:--1. In most Radiolaria the exoplasm is clearly different
  from {ix}the endoplasm, and the former is more voluminous than the
  latter. 2. In all Radiolaria the division of labour is so carried out
  between the central capsule and the extracapsulum, that the physiological
  significance and independence of both principal parts of the cell is
  almost equally great. 3. It is only in the ACANTHARIA that the formation
  of the skeleton takes place within the central capsule; in all the other
  three legions it is quite independent of it.


16. _The Malacoma and Skeleton._--Whilst the division of the unicellular
organism into central capsule and extracapsulum is undoubtedly the most
important character of the Radiolarian organism, the development of a
skeleton of peculiar and most varied form is of very striking significance.
This skeleton is _always a secondary product of the cell_, but is always
anatomically so independent, and so clearly marked off from the soft parts
or malacoma, that it seems advisable to regard both separately in a general
morphological survey. The skeleton stands in a different relation to each
of the two principal constituents of the malacoma. Only in the ACANTHARIA
is it centrogenous and developed from the central capsule outwards. In the
other three legions the skeleton never arises in the centre of the capsule;
in the NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA it is always extracapsular; in the
SPUMELLARIA it is also outside the central capsule originally, but
afterwards becomes often surrounded by it, and finally lies in most cases
partly within and partly without the central capsule. The chemical basis of
the skeleton in the ACANTHARIA is the curious acanthin (an organic
substance allied to chitin), in the PHÆODARIA a silicate of carbon, and in
the NASSELLARIA and SPUMELLARIA silica.


17. _Ground-Forms of the Radiolaria (Promorphology)._--The ground-forms of
the Radiolaria exhibit a greater variety than those of any other class in
the organic world, greater indeed than is to be found in all the remaining
groups together. For every conceivable ground-form which can be defined in
the system of promorphology is actually present in the Radiolaria; their
skeleton exhibits, as it were, in material existence, certain geometrical
ground-forms which are found in no other organisms. The cause of this
unexampled richness in different forms lies chiefly in the static relations
of the Radiolaria, which swim freely in the sea, partly also in the
peculiar plasticity of their protoplasm and the material of their
skeletons.

  Regarding the general system of ground-forms compare my Generelle
  Morphologie (1866, Bd. i. pp. 375-552; Bd. iv., Allgemeine
  Grundformenlehre). The ground-forms there proposed and systematically
  defined have, however, found but little acceptance (chiefly, no doubt,
  owing to the difficult and complicated nomenclature); but having now,
  twenty years after their publication, anew carefully revised and
  critically studied them, I can find no sufficient reason for abandoning
  the principles there adopted. On the contrary the study of the Challenger
  Radiolaria during the last ten years, with its incomparable wealth of
  forms, has only confirmed the accuracy of my system of ground-forms. The
  customary treatment of these in zoological and botanical handbooks (such
  as those of Claus and Sachs) is quite insufficient.


{x}18. _The Principal Groups of Geometrical Ground-Forms._--The great
variety of the geometrical ground-forms which are actually realised in the
variously shaped bodies of the Radiolaria, renders it desirable to classify
these in as small a number as possible of principal groups and a larger
number of subdivisions. As extensive principal groups four at least must be
distinguished; the _Centrostigma_ or Sphærotypic, the _Centraxonia_ or
Grammotypic, the _Centroplana_ or Zygotypic, and the _Acentrica_ or Atypic.
The natural centre of the body, about which all its parts are regularly
arranged, is in the first group a point (stigma), in the second a straight
line (principal axis), in the third a plane (sagittal plane), in the fourth
a centre is of course wanting.


19. _The Centrostigma or Sphærotypic Ground-Forms._--The first group of
geometrical ground-forms, here distinguished as sphærotypic or the
centrostigma, is undoubtedly the most important among the Radiolaria,
inasmuch as if these be considered monophyletic, it must be the original
one from which all the other ground-forms have been derived. The common
character of all these sphærotypic ground-forms is that their natural
centre is a point (stigma); thus there is no single principal axis (or
protaxon) such as is characteristic of the two following groups. The
sphærotypic ground-forms are subdivided into two important smaller groups,
the _spheres_ (Homaxonia) and the _endospherical polyhedra_ (Polyaxonia).
The spherical ground-forms, fully developed in the central capsule and
calymma of _Actissa_ and the #Sphæroidea# as well as in many ACANTHARIA,
present no different axes; all possible axes passing through the centre of
the body are equal (Homaxonia). In the endospherical polyhedra, on the
contrary, numerous axes (three at least) may be distinguished, which are
precisely equal to each other and different from all the remaining axes
(Polyaxonia). If the extremities of these axes, or the poles, which are all
equidistant from the common centre, be united by straight lines, a
polyhedral figure is produced whose angles all lie in the surface of the
sphere. According as the poles of the axes are at equal, subequal, or at
different distances from each other, we may divide the endospherical
polyhedra into regular, subregular and irregular. (See Gener. Morphol., Bd.
i. pp. 404-416.)


20. _The Centraxonia or Grammotypic Ground-Forms._--The second principal
group of organic ground-forms, here called grammotypic or centraxonia, is
characterised by the fact that a straight line (gramma) or a single
principal axis (protaxon) forms the natural centre of the body. This
important and extensive group is divided into two subgroups, those with one
axis (Monaxonia) and those with crossed axes (Stauraxonia); in the latter
different secondary transverse or cross-axes may be distinguished, but not
in the former. In the Monaxonia, therefore, every transverse section of the
body perpendicular to the principal axis is a circle, in the Stauraxonia,
on the contrary, a polygon. The Monaxonia are further subdivided into two
groups, in one of which the two poles of the principal axis {xi}are equal
and similar (Isopolar), in the other of which they are different
(Allopolar); in the former the two halves of the body, which are separated
by the equatorial plane (or the largest transverse plane, perpendicular to
the principal axis), are equal, in the latter unequal. Among the isopolar
uniaxial ground-forms (Monaxonia isopola) may be mentioned the ellipsoidal,
spheroidal, lenticular, &c.; to the allopolar uniaxial forms (Monaxonia
allopola) belong the conical, hemispherical, ovoid, &c. In the same way the
pyramidal ground-forms with crossed axes are divisible into two groups,
according as the two poles of the principal axis are equal or not. The
ground-form of the former is the double pyramid, that of the latter the
single pyramid. Both the double and the single pyramids may again be
subdivided, each into two important lesser groups, the regular and the
amphithect. In the first division the equatorial plane of the double and
the basal plane of the single pyramid is a regular polygon (square, &c.),
whilst in the other division it is an elongated or amphithect polygon
(rhombus, &c.); the crossed axes are equal in the former, unequal in the
latter. (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. pp. 416-494.)


21. _The Centroplana or Zygotypic Ground-Forms._--The third principal group
of ground-forms includes those which are bilaterally symmetrical in the
ordinary sense, or zeugitic or zygotypic; the natural centre of their body
is a plane. These forms are the only ones in which the distinction between
right and left is possible, since their body is divided by the median plane
(planum sagittale) into two symmetrical halves (right and left). In all
these zeugites the position of every part is determined by three axes
perpendicular to each other, and of these three dimensive axes two are
allopolar, one is isopolar. The two unlike poles of the principal (or
longitudinal) axis are the oral and aboral, the two unlike poles of the
sagittal (or vertical) axis are the dorsal and ventral; the two similar
poles of the frontal (or transverse) axis, however, are the right and left.
This important group of zeugitic or bilateral forms may also be divided
into two clearly distinct lesser groups, the _Amphipleura_ and the
_Zygopleura_. In the Amphipleura (or bilaterally radial ground-forms) the
"radial two-sided" body is produced by modification of a regular pyramid
(as _Spatangus_ from _Echinus_), and hence is composed of several (not less
than three) antimeres. In the Zygopleura (or bilaterally symmetrical
ground-forms) on the other hand, the bodies consist of two antimeres (as in
all the higher animals, Vertebrata, Arthropoda, &c.). (See Gener. Morphol.,
Bd. i. pp. 495-527.)


22. _The Acentrica or Atypic Ground-Forms._--Among the acentrica or
anaxonia are included all those ground-forms which are absolutely
irregular, and in which neither a definite centre nor constant axes can be
distinguished (_e.g._, most Sponges). These quite irregular ground-forms
are very rare among the Radiolaria, but nevertheless there may be referred
to them the amoeboid central capsule of some #Colloidea# (_Collodastrum_,
p. 27, Pl. 3, figs. 4, 5) among the SPUMELLARIA, the irregular shells of
many Collosphærida {xii}(Pl. 8, fig. 2), and the absolutely irregular
shells of the Phorticida and Soreumida among the #Larcoidea#. (See Gener.
Morphol., Bd. i. p. 400.)


23. _The Subsidiary Groups of Geometrical Ground-Forms._--The four natural
principal groups of ground-forms, which have just been defined according to
the nature of the centre of their bodies, may be divided again into
numerous subsidiary groups, defined by the relations of the constant axes
and the two poles of each axis, as well as by the number of the axes and
the differentiation of the secondary with respect to the principal axis.
The most important of these subsidiary groups into which the principal ones
are immediately divided are the following:--(1) The _Centrostigma_ (or
sphærotypic) are divided into spheres (Homaxonia) and endospherical
polyhedra (Polyaxonia). (2) The _Centraxonia_ (or grammotypic) into
uniaxial (Monaxonia) and those with crossed axes (Stauraxonia); among the
former of these may be distinguished the isopolar (phacotypic) and the
allopolar (conotypic); among the latter the double and single pyramids. (3)
The _Centroplana_ (or bilaterals) are divided into amphipleura (or
bilaterally radial) and zygopleura (or bilaterally symmetrical). (4) The
_Acentrica_ (or Anaxonia) or absolutely irregular ground-forms, present no
special subdivisions.

  For a complete system of the geometrical ground-forms and their relation
  to promorphological classification, see Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. pp.
  555-558.


24. _The Spherical or Homaxon Ground-Form._--The spherical is the only
absolutely regular ground-form, since only in it are all axes which pass
through the centre equal; it is very often realised among the Radiolaria,
especially in the SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA, where it furnishes the common
original ground-form, but it is often to be seen in the shells of many
PHÆODARIA (in most #Phæosphæria#); on the other hand, it is never found
among the NASSELLARIA. Geometrical spheres, in the strict sense of the
term, are only to be found among the SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA, namely, in
the central capsule of many #Collodaria# (Pls. 1, 2) and all #Sphæroidea#
(Pls. 11-30) as well as many Acanthometra and Acanthophracta (Pls.
128-138). Nevertheless, speaking generally, one includes those central
capsules and skeletons which have been distinguished here as endospherical
polyhedra. (On these ground-forms see Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. pp. 404-406.)


25. _The Endospherical Polyhedral Ground-Form._--The endospherical
polyhedron or polyaxon ground-form naturally follows the spherical or
homaxon. Under it are included all polyhedra whose angles fall in the
surface of a sphere; this ground-form is especially common among the
SPUMELLARIA, especially in the shells of #Sphæroidea#, but is also found
among the ACANTHARIA (especially in the Astrolophida and #Sphærophracta#),
as well as among the #Phæosphæria# (in most genera of the Orosphærida,
Sagosphærida, and Aulosphærida). Strictly speaking, all those
lattice-shells which have {xiii}been incorrectly called "spherical" belong
to this category, for they are none of them true spheres in the geometrical
sense (like the central capsules of the #Sphæroidea#), but rather
endospherical polyhedra, whose angles are indicated by the nodal points of
the lattice shell, or the radial spines which spring from them. These
endospherical polyhedra may be divided into three groups, the regular,
subregular, and irregular. Of _regular polyhedra_, properly so-called, it
may be shown geometrically that only five can exist, namely, the regular
tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron. All these are
actually manifested among the Radiolaria, although but seldom.  Much more
common are the _subregular endospherical polyhedra_, _e.g._, spherical
lattice-shells with regular hexagonal meshes of equal size; they are never
exactly equal nor perfectly regular, but the divergences are so
insignificant that they escape superficial observation (Pl. 20, figs. 3, 4;
Pl. 26, figs. 1-3). On the contrary in the _irregular endospherical
polyhedra_ the meshes of the lattice-sphere are more or less different in
size and often in form also (Pl. 28, figs. 4, 8; Pl. 30, figs. 4, 6). The
five truly regular polyhedra require separate notice on account of their
importance. (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. p. 406.)


26. _The Regular Icosahedral Ground-Form._--The ground-form whose
geometrical type is the regular icosahedron (bounded by twenty equilateral
triangles) is rarely exemplified, but it occurs among the PHÆODARIA in the
Circoporid genus _Circogonia_ (Pl. 117, fig. 1), and also in certain
Aulosphærida, but, apparently, only as an accidental variation (_e.g._,
_Aulosphæra icosahedra_). Furthermore, this ground-form may also be assumed
to occur in those #Sphæroidea# whose spherical lattice-shells bear twelve
equidistant radial spines (_e.g._, many species of _Acanthosphæra_,
_Heliosphæra_, and other Astrosphærida); the basal points of these spines
indicate the twelve angles of the regular icosahedron. (See on this head
Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. p. 411.)


27. _The Regular Dodecahedral Ground-Form._--The ground-form whose
geometrical type is the regular dodecahedron (or pentagonal dodecahedron),
bounded by twelve equilateral and equiangular pentagons, is very rarely
found perfectly developed, as in _Circorrhegma dodecahedra_ (Pl. 117, fig.
2). This form is by no means so common among the Radiolaria as in the
pollen grains of plants (_e.g._, _Buchholzia maritima_, _Fumaria spicata_,
_Polygonum amphibium_, &c.). It can, however, be regarded as present in all
those #Sphæroidea# whose spherical lattice-shells bear twenty equal and
equidistant radial spines (_e.g._, many species of _Acanthosphæra_,
_Heliosphæra_, and other Astrosphærida); the basal points of these spines
mark out the twenty angles of the regular pentagonal dodecahedron. (See
Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. p. 412.)


28. _The Regular Octahedral Ground-Form._--The ground-form whose
geometrical type is the regular octahedron (bounded by eight equilateral
triangles), commonly appears among the SPUMELLARIA in the family
Cubosphærida (p. 169, Pls. 21-25). In {xiv}these #Sphæroidea# the typical
ground-form is usually indicated by six equal radial spines, which are
opposed to each other in pairs, and lie in three similar axes perpendicular
to each other; these are the three axes of the tesseral crystallographic
system; one of them is vertical, whilst the other two cross each other at
right angles in its centre. Occasionally, too, the spherical form of the
lattice-shell passes over into that of the regular octahedron (Pl. 22,
figs. 8, 10). The same form recurs in _Circoporus_ (Pl. 117, fig. 6) among
the PHÆODARIA. In the vegetable kingdom it is exhibited by the antheridia
of _Chara_. It is not found in the NASSELLARIA and ACANTHARIA. (See Gener.
Morphol., Bd. i. p. 412.)


29. _The Regular Cubic Ground-Form._--The ground-form whose geometrical
type is that of a die or cube, is actually presented in a very striking
manner by various Radiolaria. Among the SPUMELLARIA it occurs in certain
#Sphæroidea#, _e.g._, in the Astrosphærid genera _Centrocubus_ and
_Octodendron_ (Pl. 18, figs. 1-3); in these the central medullary shell is
a complete cube, bounded by six equal squares, from the eight angles of
which eight equal radial spines project. This form can also be regarded as
present in those #Sphæroidea# whose spherical lattice-shell bears eight
equal and equidistant radial spines (many Astrosphærida). Besides these the
cubic ground-form is to be seen in certain NASSELLARIA of the family
Tympanida, especially in _Lithocubus_ (Pl. 82, fig. 12; Pl. 94, fig. 13),
in many species of _Acrocubus_, _Microcubus_, &c.; the twelve bars of its
lattice-skeleton correspond often exactly to the edges of the cube. (See
Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. p. 413.)


30. _The Regular Tetrahedral Ground-Form._--The ground-form whose
geometrical type is the regular tetrahedron, bounded by four equilateral
triangles, occurs less frequently in the Radiolaria than the other four
regular polyhedra. Among the SPUMELLARIA it is found in the #Beloidea#, and
especially in those members of the Thalassosphærida and Sphærozoida whose
spicules bear four equal branches, diverging at equal angles from a common
centre. Precisely the same structure is seen also among the NASSELLARIA in
some #Plectoidea#, as in _Tetraplagia_ among the Plagonida, and
_Tetraplecta_ among the Plectanida. The skeleton of both these genera
consists of four equal rods, which radiate at equal angles from a common
centre, just as do the axes of the regular tetrahedron. The tetrahedral
form of these #Plectoidea# is the more important and interesting since on
the one hand it is related to the similar spicular form of the #Beloidea#,
and on the other perhaps furnishes the starting point from which _Cortina_
among the NASSELLARIA may be derived (_Plagoniscus_, _Plectaniscus_). (See
Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. p. 415.)


31. _The Isopolar-Monaxon or Phacotypic Ground-Form._--The isopolar
uniaxial or phacotypic ground-form is characterised by the possession of a
vertical main axis with {xv}equal poles, whilst no transverse axes are
differentiated. All horizontal planes which cut the axis at right angles
are circles, and increase in size from the poles towards the equator. The
most important ground-forms of this group are the _phacoid_ (the lens or
oblate spheroid) and the _ellipsoid_ (or prolate spheroid). Phacoids (or
geometrical lenses with blunt margins) are very often presented by the
central capsules of the #Discoidea# and of many ACANTHARIA (Quadrilonchida
and Hexalaspida), but the lattice-shells of many SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA
exhibit the same form, as also do a few PHÆODARIA (_e.g._, _Aulophacus_).
True geometrical ellipsoids are seen in the central capsules of many
#Prunoidea# among the SPUMELLARIA, and of many Amphilonchida and
Belonaspida among the ACANTHARIA. Furthermore, the lattice shells of many
species of these groups retain the same essential form, _e.g._, many
Ellipsida, Druppulida, and Spongurida (Pls. 13-17, and 39), as well as most
Belonaspida. (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. p. 422.)


32. _Allopolar-Monaxon or Conotypic Ground-Form._--The allopolar uniaxial
or conotypic ground-form is characterised by the possession of a vertical
main axis whose two poles are unlike, while no transverse axes are
differentiated.  All horizontal planes cutting the main axis at right
angles are circles, and decrease more rapidly from the largest plane
towards the basal than towards the apical pole.  The most important
ground-forms of this group are the ovoid, the cone, and the hemisphere.
They often occur (and in geometrical perfection) in the egg-shaped central
capsule and podoconus of the NASSELLARIA, as well as in the shells of
several groups of this legion, particularly in the Cyrtocalpida or
Monocyrtida eradiata (Pl. 51, figs. 10-13), and in many Stichocyrtida
eradiata; furthermore, they are also seen among the PHÆODARIA, _e.g._,
certain Challengerida (Pl. 99, figs. 19-22). (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i.
p. 426.)


33. _The Regular Dipyramidal or Quadrilonchial Ground-Form._--The
ground-forms whose geometrical type is the regular double pyramid are
characterised by a vertical main axis which possesses equal poles, and
which is crossed at its centre by several equal transverse axes. The
horizontal equatorial plane is therefore a regular polygon, and divides the
body into two equal regular pyramids.  The simplest and commonest form of
this group is the quadratic octahedron, the ground-form of the quadratic
crystallographic system; its equatorial plane is a square. This regular
dipyramidal ground-form occurs among the SPUMELLARIA in the shells of the
Staurosphærida as well as of many #Discoidea#, in which several equidistant
radial spines or arms lie in the quadratic equatorial plane of the body,
and project from the margin of the lenticular disc (_e.g._, _Sethostaurus_,
Pl. 31; _Histiastrum_, Pl. 46, &c.). It is, however, among the ACANTHARIA
that the most important part is played by this ground-form (and especially
by the quadratic octahedron); it forms the basis of all those
#Acanthometra# and #Acanthophracta# in which twenty radial spines are
disposed according to the Müllerian Law, and in which {xvi}the four
equatorial spines are of equal dimensions (Icosacantha). (See Gener.
Morphol., Bd. i. p. 436-446.)


34. _The Amphithect Dipyramidal or Lentelliptical Ground-Forms._--The
ground-forms whose geometrical type is the lenticular or "triaxial"
ellipsoid, may also be designated amphithect double pyramids; they are
characterised by the possession of a vertical main axis which has similar
poles, and is crossed at its middle by two transverse axes, unequal but
isopolar. The horizontal equatorial plane of the body is therefore an
amphithect or elongated polygon (a rhombus in the simplest case possible),
and divides the whole body into two equal amphithect pyramids. The simplest
and commonest form of this group is the rhombic octahedron, which is also
the ground-form of the rhombic crystallographic system. It plays an
important part in those ACANTHARIA in which twenty radial spines are
disposed according to the Müllerian Law, but in which the two pairs of
equatorial spines are unequal (different geotomical and hydrotomical axes,
see p. 719); to this category belong the Amphilonchida (Pl. 132),
Belonaspida (Pl. 136), Hexalaspida (Pl. 139), and Diploconida (Pl. 140). A
form essentially identical obtains also among the SPUMELLARIA in the
majority of the #Larcoidea#, both in their triaxial lattice-shells, and in
their lentelliptical central capsules, which present geometrically accurate
triaxial ellipsoids, with three unequal isopolar axes at right angles to
each other. (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. p. 446-452.)


35. _The Regular Pyramidal Ground-Forms._--The ground-forms whose
geometrical type is the regular pyramid, and which are the most conspicuous
in the Medusæ, Polyps, Corals, and regular Echinoderms (the Radiata of
earlier authors), are almost confined among the Radiolaria to the legion
NASSELLARIA; they occur, however, in the great majority of these, and
especially in those families which may be classed together as "#Cyrtoidea#
triradiata et multiradiata." Strictly speaking, however, almost all these
NASSELLARIA, at all events in their origin, are bilateral or dipleuric,
since the primary sagittal ring with its characteristic apophyses marks out
the sagittal median plane, and further, since the three feet of the basal
tripod are usually divided into an unpaired dorsal (pes caudalis) and two
paired ventral or lateral (pedes pectorales, dexter et sinister). On the
other hand, it is noteworthy, firstly, that among the primitive
#Plectoidea# there are perfectly regular radial forms, without any
indication of an original bilateral symmetry, and secondly, that similar
forms are also very common among the #Cyrtoidea#, probably as secondary
radial forms, developed from primitive bilateral ones. Similar cases also
occur in certain PHÆODARIA (_e.g._, the Medusettida and Tuscarorida, Pls.
100, 120), but they are entirely wanting among the ACANTHARIA and
SPUMELLARIA. The multiradial NASSELLARIA have arisen from the triradial by
the interpolation of three, six, nine, or more interradial and adradial
secondary apophyses between the three primary perradial ones. (See Gener.
Morphol., Bd. i. pp. 459-874.)


{xvii}36. _The Amphithect Pyramidal Ground-Forms._--The ground-forms whose
geometrical type is the amphithect pyramid, are distinguished from the
regular pyramidal forms, just discussed, chiefly by the form of the basal
plane, which is not a regular, but an amphithect or elongated polygon (in
the simplest case a rhombus). Hence in this case the allopolar main axis of
the body is crossed by two transverse axes which are isopolar and at right
angles, but are unequal; they cannot, however be distinguished as sagittal
and frontal axes as is the case in the zeugites. In the animal as well as
in the vegetable kingdom, an important part is played by this ground-form,
_e.g._, in the Ctenophora, where it is the rhombic pyramid.  Among the
Radiolaria it is not common, though it is clearly expressed among the
NASSELLARIA in a number of #Stephoidea# (Stephanida and Tympanida), as well
as in many #Spyroidea# (_e.g._, the bipedal Zygospirida). It is very
accurately developed among the PHÆODARIA in the bivalved #Phæoconchia#
(Pls. 121-128), where the two valves of the shell (dorsal and ventral) are
generally exactly alike, their median keels corresponding to the poles of
the sagittal axis. In the slit between the two valves lie the two secondary
openings (right and left) of the tripylean central capsule, corresponding
to the two poles of the frontal axis, and the main axis stands
perpendicularly to both these, its oral pole being indicated by the
astropyle, or principal aperture. (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. pp.
479-494.)


37. _The Amphipleural Ground-Forms._--By the term amphipleural ground-forms
are to be understood those usually defined as "bilaterally radial"; their
geometrical type is a half amphithect pyramid. The best known examples of
this form in the animal kingdom are the bilateral five-rayed Echinoderms
(_Spatangus_, _Clypeaster_), in the vegetable kingdom the symmetrical
five-rayed flowers (_Viola_, _Trifolium_). The three dimensive axes have
the same relation as in the zygopleura, to be next discussed, and which
also resemble them in being divisible only by one plane (the sagittal
median plane) into two equal halves. They differ, however, the amphipleural
body not being made up of two antimeres, but of at least three pairs of
antimeres (or three parameres), being therefore primitively radial. Hence
each of the symmetrical halves of the body contains more than one antimere.
Among the Radiolaria this form does not occur in the SPUMELLARIA,
ACANTHARIA, or PHÆODARIA; it is very common, however, among the
NASSELLARIA; many #Cyrtoidea# multiradiata and #Spyroidea# multiradiata
show this bilaterally radial ground-form, inasmuch as the body consists of
two symmetrical halves, and is also composed of numerous (usually three,
six, nine, or more) radial parameres. In the multiradiate Dicyrtida and
Tricyrtida the cephalis (the first joint) is usually bilateral, whilst the
thorax (the second joint) is multiradial. (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. pp.
495-506.)


38. _The Zygopleural Ground-Forms._--As zygopleural or dipleural
ground-forms, as opposed to the amphipleural, are classed those zeugites or
centroplana which are known {xviii}as "bilaterally symmetrical" in the
strictest sense of the term. This is the most important ground-form in the
animal kingdom, inasmuch as it obtains almost exclusively among the higher
animals (Vertebrata, Articulata, Mollusca, Vermes). The body consists of
only two antimeres, which correspond to the two symmetrical halves of the
body. Of the three dimensive axes two are allopolar, one isopolar; the oral
pole of the longitudinal main axis is different from the aboral; the dorsal
pole of the sagittal axis is different from the ventral; but the right pole
of the frontal axis is equal to the left. The right antimere is usually
precisely similar to the left (Eudipleura), more rarely it is slightly
dissimilar or asymmetrical (Dysdipleura). Among the Radiolaria this
ground-form is entirely wanting in the Porulosa or Holotrypasta
(SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA), but on the contrary it is very common in the
Osculosa or Merotrypasta (NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA). In the NASSELLARIA it
is of special importance, for the typical _Cortina_ (the combination of the
primary sagittal ring with the basal tripod) exhibits the zygopleural
ground-form clearly sketched out; indeed it is usually clearly seen even in
the sagittal ring itself, for its ventral segment is more strongly curved
than the dorsal; its basal (or oral) pole is always different from the
apical (or aboral). Of the three feet of the basal tripod the unpaired
(caudal) one is directed dorsally and backwards, the two paired (pectoral)
ones ventrally and forwards. The majority of the NASSELLARIA may be
regarded as modifications of this original ground-form. Its relation to the
primitively triradiate tripod presents a still unsolved problem, and the
numerous relations of the zygopleural to the multiradiate ground-forms in
the NASSELLARIA are exceedingly complicated. The zygopleural ground-form is
less widely distributed among the PHÆODARIA, though it is very
characteristically developed in the rich and varied group of Challengerida
(Pl. 99). (See Gener. Morphol., Bd. i. pp. 507-527.)

40. _Mechanical Causes of the Geometrical Ground-Forms._--The great variety
of ground-forms exhibited by the Radiolaria is of special interest, since
in most instances their causes admit of recognition, and since they are so
intimately related to each other that even in the remaining cases the
assumption that they have arisen by purely mechanical _causæ efficientes_
seems justified. In this respect the first rank is taken by statical
conditions, especially the indifferent or stable equilibrium of the whole
organism, which floats freely in the water. With regard to these
fundamental statical relations, three principal groups of ground-forms may
be distinguished, pantostatic, polystatic, and monostatic.


41. _Pantostatic Ground-Forms._--By pantostatic or indifferently stable
ground-forms are meant those in which the centre of gravity coincides with
the centre of the body, so that they are in equilibrium in any given
position. Strictly speaking, the only form which possesses perfectly
indifferent equilibrium is the sphere, that being the only truly homaxon
and perfectly regular form. Nevertheless, in a somewhat wider sense many
Polyaxonia, especially the endospherical polyhedra with very numerous
sides, may be {xx}included in this category. Such indifferently stable
bodies are found among the SPUMELLARIA in many #Collodaria# and
#Sphæroidea#, as well as in the Astrolophida among the ACANTHARIA. On the
contrary they are entirely wanting among the NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA,
since their central capsule constantly presents a main axis with a
differentiated basal pole, and determines the position of stable
equilibrium.


42. _Polystatic Ground-Forms._--Those ground forms are defined as
polystatic or multistable in which the body is in equilibrium in several
different positions (though not in an infinite number). The number of these
positions is usually twice as many as that of the constant equal isopolar
axes exhibited by the form. Hence the regular polyhedra have as many
positions of equilibrium as they have angles or sides, the icosahedron
twenty, dodecahedron twelve, octahedron eight, cube six, tetrahedron four.
The isopolar monaxon ground-forms (lens, ellipsoid, cylinder) and the
diplopyramidal ground forms (quadrilonchial and lentelliptical) have two
positions of stable equilibrium, since the two poles of the vertical axis
are equal and similar and the body is divided into equal halves by the
equatorial plane. This is the case in many SPUMELLARIA (especially
#Discoidea#, #Prunoidea#, and #Larcoidea#), as well as in the great
majority of ACANTHARIA. Perhaps the same holds good also in certain
NASSELLARIA (_e.g._, isopolar Tympanida) and PHÆODARIA (_e.g._, isopolar
#Phæosphæria#), though here unistable equilibrium appears to be
necessitated by the constant main axis of the central capsule and the
differentiated basal pole of the main axis.


43. _Monostatic Ground-Forms._--Those ground-forms are classed as
monostatic or unistable in which the body is in equilibrium only in one
position, since the centre of gravity of the body lies in a constant
vertical axis below its centre. This fixed position is only rarely and
exceptionally found among the SPUMELLARIA (_e.g._, in _Xiphostylus_,
_Sphærostylus_, _Lithomespilus_, _Lithapium_) and among the ACANTHARIA
(_e.g._, in _Zygostaurus_ and _Amphibelone_). On the contrary it is quite
usual among the NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA (with but few exceptions); for
here a vertical main axis, with a differentiated basal pole, is determined
even by the formation of the central capsule, and usually also by the
corresponding structure of the skeleton. Among the NASSELLARIA this basal
pole, with the porochora of the central capsule, appears always to be the
lower; as also in most #Phæogromia# among the PHÆODARIA. In the peculiar
bivalved #Phæoconchia#, on the other hand, the basal pole with the
cannopyle is directed upwards; as also in the Challengerida and
Tuscarorida. The #Phæosphæria# and #Phæocystina# are probably to a large
extent polystatic. In general unistable equilibrium may be assumed in the
following categories of ground-forms:--(1) Allopolar monaxon (conical and
ovoid); (2) pyramidal (regular and amphithect); (3) Centroplana
(amphipleura and zygopleura); (4) Anaxonia.


{xxi}44. _Principal Axes._--From the foregoing consideration of the
statical conditions and their direct causal connection with the geometrical
ground-forms of the Radiolaria, the great mechanical significance of the
differentiation of definite axes in these unicellular free-swimming
organisms will be manifest. The most important of these is the primary main
axis (axis principalis, or protaxon), which in all cases has a vertical
direction. It is wanting in the Centrostigma (spheres and endospherical
polyhedra), and in the Anaxonia (acentra). It is isopolar in the phacotypic
forms (Monaxonia isopola), and in the double pyramids (Stauraxonia
isopola). It is allopolar in all monastatic ground-forms, in the conotypic
forms (Monaxonia allopola), pyramids (Stauraxonia allopola), and the
Centroplana (or bilateral forms).


45. _Secondary or Transverse Axes._--In contrast to the vertical main axis
all the other constant axes differentiated in the body may be called
"secondary axes," or "transverse axes," since they cross the former at
definite points. All ground-forms whose vertical axis is crossed by a fixed
number of such axes at definite angles may be called "Stauraxonia." They
are divided into two groups, double pyramids and single pyramids; in the
former the two poles of the main axis (or the two halves of the body
separated by the equatorial plane) are similar (Stauraxonia homopola), in
the latter dissimilar (Stauraxonia heteropola). If all the secondary axes
be equal, the stauraxon ground-form is regularly radial. If some of them be
unequal they are arranged in certain relations towards two primary
transverse axes, perpendicular to each other, to which all the other
secondary axes are subsidiary; the ground-forms are then either amphithect
or bilateral. The two primary transverse axes, which may also be designated
"ideal transverse axes" (euthyni), divide the vertical main axis in its
centre; one of them is the sagittal, the other the frontal. These three
dimensive axes give the factors which accurately determine the ground-form
and the dimensions in most Radiolaria; the vertical main axis determines
the length (principal axis); one horizontal transverse axis determines the
thickness (sagittal axis), and the other the breadth (frontal axis). Those
ground-forms in which the transverse axes are isopolar are termed
"amphithect," and those in which the one (frontal or lateral) is isopolar
and the other (sagittal or dorso-ventral) is allopolar, are termed
"bilateral," or better "zeugitic."


46. _Primary and Secondary Ground-Forms._--The geometrical sphere must be
regarded as the original ground-form of the Radiolaria; it being understood
that its monophyletic derivation from a single stem-form, _Actissa_, is
correct. The simplest forms of _Actissa_ (_Procyttarium_, Pl. 1, fig. 1)
are in fact geometrically _perfect spheres_; indeed even the individual
parts which compose their unicellular bodies (nucleolus, nucleus, central
capsule and calymma) are concentric spheres. But in addition the central
capsules of most other SPUMELLARIA, especially the #Sphæroidea#, as well as
of many ACANTHARIA {xxii}are true spheres. Furthermore the simple or
concentrically composed lattice-spheres of #Sphæroidea#, #Sphærophracta#,
and #Phæosphæria# may be regarded as spheres, although strictly speaking
they are endospherical polyhedra. From the primary spherical form of the
Radiolaria all other secondary forms may be derived in the following
order:--1. By the development of a main axis the Monaxonia arise. 2. By the
development of transverse axes the Stauraxonia arise. 3. In both groups
(Monaxonia and Stauraxonia) the two poles (or upper and lower halves of the
body) are at first similar (Isopola). 4. By differentiation in the two
poles or halves of the body (distinction between the basal pole and the
apical) the forms with different poles (Allopola) arise. 5. The transverse
axes of the Stauraxonia are at first equal (regular pyramids and double
pyramids). 6. By differentiation in the transverse axes (distinction
between the sagittal and the frontal axis) the amphithect pyramids and
double pyramids arise. 7. From the amphithect pyramids the Amphipleura
arise by differentiation of both poles of the sagittal axis. 8. The
zygopleural ground-form appears last, as the simplest form of the
Amphipleura.


47. _The Ground-Forms of the Spumellaria._--The SPUMELLARIA, being the
oldest and most primitive Radiolaria, have for the most part either
indifferent or multistable equilibrium; _e.g._, all #Colloidea# and
#Beloidea# which have a spherical central capsule, and also most
#Sphæroidea#. Among these primitive Centrostigma true spheres and
endospherical polyhedra are represented in the utmost variety, and the
regular polyhedra in particular. By the development of a vertical main axis
these Centrostigma have also given rise to very numerous Centraxonia, which
are usually isopolar, very rarely allopolar. Sometimes they are Monaxonia
(circular in transverse section), sometimes Stauraxonia (polygonal in
transverse section). The vertical main axis is longer in the #Prunoidea#,
shorter in the #Discoidea# than any of the other axes. The #Larcoidea# are
distinguished by their lentelliptical or triaxial ellipsoid form; the three
different but isopolar axes corresponding with those of the rhombic
octahedron; but even among the #Sphæroidea#, #Prunoidea#, and #Discoidea#,
this form is sometimes produced by the differentiation of two different
transverse axes at right angles to each other. Whilst these ground-forms
(Centraxonia and Centrostigma) occur in the utmost variety among the
SPUMELLARIA, the centroplanar (or true bilateral) ground-form is entirely
wanting.


48. _The Ground-Forms of Acantharia._--In the small family Astrolophida,
which contains the most archaic forms of the legion (_Actinelius_,
_Astrolophus_), the ACANTHARIA show a direct relation to the most primitive
SPUMELLARIA (_Actissa_), and like these have indifferent equilibrium; their
central capsule is a sphere, their calymma an endospherical polyhedron,
whose angles are indicated by the distal ends of the numerous {xxiii}equal
radial spines. In the great majority of ACANTHARIA, however (all
#Acanthonida# and #Acanthophracta#), twenty radial spines are present,
regularly distributed, according to Müller's icosacanthan law, in five
parallel circles, each containing four crossed spines (p. 717). Usually the
twenty spines are equal, and the ground-form is the quadratic octahedron,
or a regular double pyramid with sixteen sides. But in some groups (the
Amphilonchida and Prunophracta) two opposite equatorial spines are much
more strongly developed than the other eighteen, and therefore the
hydrotomical axis in the equatorial plane is larger than the geotomical
axis (p. 719); the isopolar stauraxonian form passes over into the
allopolar, and the ground-form becomes the rhombic octahedron or the
amphithect double pyramid (compare §§ 33 and 34, and p. 720). The
centroplanar ground-form is entirely wanting in the ACANTHARIA.


49. _The Ground-Forms of the Nassellaria._--The NASSELLARIA all possess
monostatic ground-forms, inasmuch as by the very structure of their
monopylean central capsule a vertical main axis is necessitated, whose
basal pole occupies the porochora. The same arrangement is also for the
most part clearly recognisable in the corresponding structure of the
skeleton, which is generally either centraxon or centroplanar. Among their
manifold skeletal forms different larger groups of ground-forms may be
recognised according as the vertical allopolar main axis is crossed by
differentiated transverse axes or not (Stauraxonia or Monaxonia); the
former are either triradial or multiradial. The triradial, with three
lateral or terminal radial apophyses, constitute the greater part of the
NASSELLARIA, and have probably been derived originally from the triradial
#Plectoidea# (_Triplagia_, _Triplecta_); a more careful examination,
however (especially with reference to the structure of the cortinar
septum), reveals the fact that the ground-form is not strictly regularly
pyramidal (with three equal radii), but amphipleural (with two paired
ventral and one unpaired dorsal radius), and that it usually passes over
into a distinctly zygopleural form. The same holds true of the multiradial
NASSELLARIA, where for the most part three interradial or six adradial
(sometimes more) apophyses are intercalated between the three primary
perradial ones; sometimes here also the ground-form is a quite regular
hexagonal or nonagonal pyramid, but usually it is more or less amphithect
or amphipleural. Among the eradial NASSELLARIA, which have no radial
apophyses, the ground-form is sometimes allopolar monaxon (conical, ovoid,
hemispherical, &c.), sometimes amphithect pyramidal (even in the simplest
Stephanida, _Archicircus_, &c.), or sometimes distinctly zygopleural or
bilateral (many #Plectellaria#).


50. _The Ground-Forms of the Phæodaria._--The PHÆODARIA agree with the
NASSELLARIA in the possession of a primitively centraxon ground-form, and
like them are monostatic, since a vertical main axis whose basal pole
passes through the astropyle is present, owing to the characteristic
structure of their cannopylean central capsule. In {xxiv}the great majority
of PHÆODARIA the spheroidal central capsule also possesses a pair of
parapylæ near the opposite apical pole of the main axis (Tripylea), and
these determine (as the right and left secondary openings) an isopolar
frontal axis. Hence, strictly speaking, in most PHÆODARIA the central
capsule has the geometrical ground-form of the amphithect pyramid (as in
the Ctenophora), with an allopolar vertical main axis, and two unequal, but
isopolar, horizontal transverse axes. In many PHÆODARIA the skeleton also
has this amphithect pyramidal ground-form, _e.g._, the bivalved
#Phæoconchia# and part of the #Phæogromia#. On the contrary, in the rest of
the PHÆODARIA the skeleton exhibits very various geometrical ground-forms,
independent of that of the central capsule. In the #Phæosphæria# it forms
preferably spheres or endospherical polyhedra, as also in the Castanellida
and Circoporida among the #Phæogromia#; among the Circoporida there are
also seen with remarkable distinctness the regular polyhedra (especially
the dodecahedron and icosahedron). Isopolar monaxonia are found among the
Aulosphærida (_Aulatractus_) and Orosphærida; allopolar monaxonia among the
Challengerida (_Lithogromia_). The Medusettida and Tuscarorida show various
forms of regular pyramids (allopolar Stauraxonia); and finally, the
Challengerida are for the most part centroplanar or bilateral. Thus the
PHÆODARIA present a great wealth of different geometrical ground-forms in
the development of their skeleton, not in that of their central capsule.



CHAPTER II.--THE CENTRAL CAPSULE.


51. _Components of the Central Capsule._--In all Radiolaria without
exception, at some period of life or other, the central portion of the soft
body is separated from the peripheral portion by an independent,
anatomically recognisable membrane; this membrane with all its contents is
designated the central capsule, and is the peculiar central organ of the
unicellular body, which distinguishes the Radiolaria most clearly from the
other Rhizopoda. In the great majority of the Radiolaria the volume of the
central capsule is less than that of the surrounding peripheral soft body
which we place in opposition to it as "extracapsulum." The
"capsule-membrane," which separates these two constituents, arises very
early in most Radiolaria, and persists throughout their whole life. In some
species, however, the membrane only appears later, immediately before the
formation of the spores, and hence is absent for a considerable period.
Regarded as a whole, then, the capsule consists of the following
parts:--(1) the capsule-membrane; (2) the enclosed endoplasm, or
intracapsular protoplasm; (3) the nucleus. But in addition, many other
non-essential structures may be enclosed in the central capsule, especially
hyaline spheres (vacuoles), fatty spheres, pigment granules, crystals, &c.

  The central capsule was first described in my Monograph in 1862 (pp.
  69-82) as the most characteristic component of the Radiolarian organism,
  and distinguished from the whole extracapsular {xxv}soft body. The fact
  that it has recently been reported as absent by various authors is due to
  their having observed young or unripe specimens, before the formation of
  the spores. In some species of #Polycyttaria# and ACANTHARIA the membrane
  persists only a very short time.


52. _The Primary Form of the Central Capsule._--The form of the central
capsule is originally a geometrical sphere; and if in accordance with our
monophyletic hypothesis all Radiolaria are to be derived from one common
stem-form (_Actissa_, see p. 12), then the central capsule of this common
stem-form must be regarded as perfectly spherical (_Procyttarium_, p. 13,
Pl. 1, fig. 1). Since, further, the enclosed nucleus and the surrounding
calymma of this primitive archaic form must also be spheres, and since the
nucleus lies in the centre of the body, and the protoplasm is evenly
distributed between it and the membrane, it follows that no axes or
excentrically differentiated parts are to be distinguished in this most
primitive Radiolarian. Rather in the primary central capsule all parts are
concentrically and evenly arranged round its centre. This primary spherical
form becomes modified in most Radiolaria into various secondary
ground-forms, which are correlated partly with the structure of the capsule
itself, and partly also with the development of openings in its membrane.
In general the ground-form of the central capsule is polyaxon in the
Porulosa (SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA); but in the Osculosa centraxon forms
are more frequently observed; in the NASSELLARIA the ovoid (allopolar
monaxon) form is predominant, and in the PHÆODARIA the rhomboid or
amphithect pyramid. In these latter, the astropyle indicates the basal pole
of the vertical main axis, whilst the two parapylæ (right and left) mark
the poles of the frontal transverse axis. In the NASSELLARIA the centre of
the porochora corresponds with the basal pole of the main axis, whilst no
transverse axes are originally present.


53. _The Secondary Forms of the Central Capsule._--The original purely
spherical form of the central capsule persists only in the minority of the
Radiolaria, namely, the greater part of the SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA; it
passes over into various other secondary forms in the majority of the
class, in the whole of the NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA, and in a considerable
portion of the SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA. These secondary or derived forms
may be divided into two quite distinct groups, which may be designated
endometamorphic and exometamorphic; in the former the cause of the
divergence of the secondary form from the sphere lies in the internal
structure of the central capsule; in the latter it lies in the external
influence exerted by the growth of the skeleton. Obviously the former
series of modifications is more significant than the latter.


54. _The Endometamorphic Forms of the Central Capsule._--The secondary
forms of the central capsule, which are due to internal causes connected
with its growth, are as follows:--

  {xxvi}A. _The Ellipsoidal Central Capsule_, with one axis elongated, so
  that it becomes the vertical main axis of the body.

55. _The Exometamorphic Forms of the Central Capsule._--The secondary forms
of the central capsule, which are brought about by external causes, chiefly
dependent on the formation of the skeleton, are very various and in many
cases devoid of special interest; in other instances, on the contrary, they
are of great importance, because of the clear relation of cause and effect
which can be traced between the development of the skeleton and of the
capsule. The most important phenomena to be recorded in this connection are
as follows:--

  {xxvii}I. SPUMELLARIA.--(A) In many of the #Sphæroidea#, the central
  capsule of which is originally enclosed by a simple lattice-sphere, it
  puts out protrusions through the meshes of the shell, thus forming
  club-shaped processes, corresponding in number with the meshes of the
  lattice (Pl. 11, figs. 1, 5; Pl. 20, fig. 1_a_; Pl. 27, fig. 3, &c.). The
  whole surface of the spherical capsule may thus be covered with numerous
  independent radial clubs of equal size, but usually they unite again
  outside the shell to form a simple sphere with smooth surface. (B) In
  many #Prunoidea# whose originally ellipsoidal body has become cylindrical
  by the marked prolongation of the main axis, the central capsule is
  divided by a series of constrictions into segments, which correspond with
  the annular constrictions of the skeleton (Pls. 39, 40). (C) In most
  #Discoidea# whose lentiform or discoidal shell develops radial arms at
  its margin, the central capsule sends out processes into these arms, and
  adapts itself to the stellate form of the skeleton (p. 409, Pl. 43, fig.
  15; Pl. 47, &c.) (D) In many #Larcoidea# whose growth is originally
  lentelliptical, but later spiral or irregular, the central capsule
  follows the mode of growth and develops irregular protuberances.


  II. ACANTHARIA.--Whilst the central capsule of most ACANTHARIA retains
  its primitive spherical form, in a minority of the group it passes over
  into various secondary forms, which are directly determined by the growth
  of the skeleton; especially common are lappet or club-shaped prominences
  which follow the larger radial spines. Hence the central capsule may
  assume the form of a violin, with two lobes corresponding to the two
  poles of the elongated main axis, as in many Amphilonchida (p. 782, Pl.
  132, fig. 10), and the Diploconida (p. 884, Pl. 140). On the other hand
  the central capsule becomes cruciform, with four lobes disposed at right
  angles, as in Lithoptera and other Quadrilonchida (p. 768, Pl. 131, fig.
  10, &c.).


  III. NASSELLARIA.--The primitive ellipsoid or ovoid form of the central
  capsule persists only in a few NASSELLARIA, such as the simplest and most
  archaic forms, the Nassellida, many #Plectoidea#, #Stephoidea#,
  Monocyrtida, &c. In the great majority of the NASSELLARIA, on the
  contrary, the ellipsoid or ovoid form passes over into a secondary form
  which is usually characterised by the presence of lobes, and is obviously
  dependent upon the previous development of the skeleton. In many
  #Stephoidea# and #Spyroidea# (probably the majority), a bilobed central
  capsule is formed (with symmetrically equal right and left lobes), since
  the primary vertical sagittal ring interferes with the growth in the
  median plane (Pl. 90, figs. 7-10). In other {xxviii}#Spyroidea#, on the
  contrary, and the majority of the #Cyrtoidea#, the central capsule forms
  at its basis rounded lobes, which protrude and hang down from the meshes
  of the cortinar plate; and since this latter has usually three or four
  large pores, the capsule similarly develops three or four processes (Pl.
  53, fig. 19; Pl. 55, figs. 4-11; Pl. 59, figs. 4-13; Pl. 60, figs. 3-7;
  Pl. 65, fig. 1).


56. _The Membrane of the Central Capsule._--The capsule-membrane or
envelope of the central capsule is both morphologically and physiologically
one of the most important parts of the Radiolarian body, for it separates
its two main constituents, the capsule with its nucleus and endoplasm and
the extracapsulum with the calymma and exoplasm. The capsule-membrane is
invariably present at some time or other during the life of the organism,
even though in a few species it may persist only for a short time. It is
characterised in general by its power of resistance to chemical and
physical reagents, and appears to be related to the elastic tissues or
perhaps even more to the chitinous substances. Its thickness is usually
less than 0.0001, though in certain groups it ranges between 0.001 and
0.002, and in many of the larger Radiolaria (such as Collida and PHÆODARIA)
it may attain a thickness of 0.003 to 0.006 or more. In the three legions
SPUMELLARIA, ACANTHARIA, and NASSELLARIA the capsule-membrane is single,
while in the PHÆODARIA it is always double, being composed of a firm outer
and a delicate inner membrane, which are in contact at only few points.
Usually it is quite structureless, except for its apertures; the thicker
membrane showing occasionally a fine concentric lamination. In certain
large #Colloidea# (_e.g._, _Thalassicolla_, Pl. 1, fig. 5_b_) the membrane
is covered on the inner surface by a network of polygonal ridges, and in
some large PHÆODARIA with remarkable small curved rods (Pl. 114, fig. 13).
In all Radiolaria the membrane is perforated by definite openings or pores,
through which the intracapsular and extracapsular protoplasm are in direct
communication. These openings (or "pylae") show very characteristic and
constant differences in the four legions, which have given rise to the
names--PERIPYLEA, ACTIPYLEA, MONOPYLEA, CANNOPYLEA.

  The capsule-membrane was first indicated as the most important and
  absolutely constant component of all Radiolaria, and as the differential
  character of the class, in my Monograph (1862, pp. 69-71). The careful
  investigations of R. Hertwig have confirmed this view and at the same
  time have yielded the most important conclusions regarding the nature and
  systematic significance of the openings in the capsule (_op. cit._, 1879,
  pp. 105-107). On the contrary, Karl Brandt has recently propounded the
  theory that the capsule-membrane is by no means a constant part of the
  Radiolarian organism, but is lacking in certain species of _Collozoum_
  and _Sphærozoum_ (1881, p. 392). This contradiction is explained by the
  fact that in some #Collodaria# and #Acanthometra# the formation of the
  central capsule takes place much later than in the other Radiolaria, in
  some {xxix}species indeed only just prior to the development of the swarm
  spores. I have recognised the presence of it in all species which I have
  investigated (more than a thousand), and even in those in which Brandt
  denies its existence. It is often very delicate and may easily be
  overlooked, especially when the contents of the capsule are colourless,
  but in all cases by the prudent application of staining fluids and other
  reagents its presence may be demonstrated. Even in those cases in which
  the contour of the capsule was not visible, and its contents appeared to
  pass without definite boundary into the matrix of the extracapsulum, it
  was possible by the use of appropriate stains or reagents, which would
  not penetrate the capsule, or of those solvents which were capable of
  dissolving its contents and of causing it to swell up like a distended
  bladder, to recognise the existence of the membrane. Those Radiolaria in
  which it is truly absent are young animals of species in which the
  membrane is only formed immediately before sporification, and persists
  but for a short time (_e.g._, species of _Collozoum_, _Sphærozoum_,
  _Acanthometra_, _Acanthochiasma_, &c.).


57. _The Capsule-Openings of the Peripylea (or Spumellaria)._--The
capsule-membrane of the PERIPYLEA is generally perforated by extremely fine
and numerous pores, which are distributed at equal distances over the whole
surface, and are precisely alike in all parts of the capsule. Hence the
SPUMELLARIA may be called "Holotrypasta" or "Porulosa"; they agree with the
ACTIPYLEA in being devoid of an osculum or operculum; they are
distinguished from the latter group mainly in that their pores are equally
distributed over the whole surface of the capsule, whilst in the ACTIPYLEA
the pores are disposed in definite groups or lines, separated by large
imporous areas.

  The central capsule of the SPUMELLARIA, with its innumerable fine and
  evenly distributed pores, must be regarded as the primitive arrangement,
  from which the different central capsules of the three other legions have
  been developed. The central capsule of the ACTIPYLEA has been derived
  from that of the PERIPYLEA by reduction in the number of the pores and
  their distribution in definite, regularly disposed areas in the membrane.
  The central capsule of the Osculosa is characterised by the formation of
  a special main-aperture (osculum) at the basal pole, which is closed in
  the MONOPYLEA by the porochora, and in the CANNOPYLEA by the astropyle;
  the remaining pores, with the exception of the accessory openings of many
  CANNOPYLEA, remain undeveloped in both these legions. In the same way
  Hertwig regards the central capsule of the PERIPYLEA as the primitive
  form (1879, L. N. 33, p. 107).


58. _The Capsule-Openings of the Actipylea (or Acantharia)._--The
capsule-membrane of the ACTIPYLEA is perforated by very numerous fine
pores, which are regularly distributed over the surface of the central
capsule, and separated by imporous intervals. Hence the ACANTHARIA belong
to the "Holotrypasta" or "Porulosa"; they have neither osculum nor
operculum, and agree in this particular with the PERIPYLEA; but they are
separated from these latter chiefly by the fact that their pores are much
less numerous, and marked off into regularly arranged groups or lines by
imporous intervals. In the PERIPYLEA, on the contrary, the pores are much
more numerous and are evenly distributed over the whole surface of the
capsule.

  {xxx}The central capsule of the ACANTHARIA has hitherto been for the most
  part confounded with that of the SPUMELLARIA, and no clear distinction
  has been drawn in this respect between the two legions of the Porulosa.
  Hertwig, who in 1879 first discovered the remarkably different structure
  of the Osculosa (NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA), recognised no distinction
  between the structure of the capsules in the PERIPYLEA and ACTIPYLEA (his
  Acanthometrea), and supposed that in both these legions "very fine pores
  were evenly distributed in large numbers over the capsule-membrane"
  (_loc. cit._, p. 106). I have, however, during the last few years
  convinced myself, by the careful comparative investigation of numerous
  ACANTHARIA, that in this respect they are quite distinct from the
  SPUMELLARIA (with perhaps the exception of the Astrolophida, which are
  nearly related to the primitive _Actissa_). The number of pores in the
  ACTIPYLEA is usually very much smaller than in the PERIPYLEA, and they
  are regularly arranged in groups.


59. _The Capsule-Openings of the Monopylea (or Nassellaria.)_--The
capsule-membrane of the MONOPYLEA always possesses a single large
main-opening, an osculum, which lies at the basal pole of the main axis,
and is closed by a circular perforated lid (operculum porosum). When seen
from the surface this lid appears as a clearly defined porous area
(porochora or area porosa), and forms the horizontal base of a peculiar
cone, which stands vertically in the interior of the capsule and may be
designated the "thread-cone" (podoconus). The NASSELLARIA may hence be
termed "Merotrypasta" or "Osculosa," like the CANNOPYLEA; the structure and
significance of the circular lid (operculum), which closes the main-opening
(osculum) is, however, quite different in the two legions. Whilst the lid
of the CANNOPYLEA (astropyle) is solid, traversed by radial ribs, and only
perforated in its centre by a short tube (proboscis), in the MONOPYLEA the
operculum (porochora) is always perforated by numerous vertical fine pores,
and is in connection with the peculiar internal "pseudopodial cone"
(podoconus, Pl. 51, figs. 5, 13; Pl. 81, fig. 16; Pl. 91, fig. 5; Pl. 98,
fig. 13). The pores are separated by small vertical, highly refractive rods
(opercular rhabdillæ); these become intensely stained by carmine, and are
either evenly distributed over the surface of the porochora or arranged in
definite groups. The outer or distal end of each rod is rounded, sometimes
thickened like a club or split into lobes; the inner or proximal end is
usually pointed, and stands in connection with a myophane thread of the
podoconus (see § 79). The primary circular form of the porochora, in which
the opercular rhabdillæ are evenly distributed in a horizontal plane,
undergoes various secondary modifications in many NASSELLARIA. The
triradial structure of the skeleton, which characterises the majority of
the legion, causes a splitting of the base of the central capsule into
three or four lobes; this division also affects the porochora, which lies
in the centre of the base, so that the rhabdillæ become arranged in three
or four equal circles. If, however, the lobes of the central capsule become
larger and protrude through the three or four collar pores of the cortinar
septum, the central porochora may separate entirely into three or four
elongated tracts, which lie on the axial side of the magnified lobes; the
rhabdillæ are then arranged over the whole surface of {xxxi}these tracts,
on the outer aspect of which run the longitudinal myophane fibrillæ of the
podoconus (compare §§ 79 and 99).

  The porous area of the MONOPYLEA was first described by Hertwig in 1879,
  and shown to be the characteristic main-opening of the central capsule in
  various families belonging to this legion (L. N. 33, pp. 71, 73, 83, 106,
  Taf. vii., viii.). According to his view "the capsule-membrane in the
  porous area becomes thickened around each pore into a rod, perforated by
  a canal," and the intracapsular protoplasm passes outwards through these
  fine canals (_loc. cit._, p. 106). I am not able to share this
  interpretation, but think rather that I have convinced myself by the
  examination of some living NASSELLARIA, and of many well-stained and
  preserved preparations in the Challenger collection, that the rods are
  _solid_, specially modified portions of the capsular wall, and that the
  protoplasm does not pass through them but through pores which lie between
  them.


60. _The Capsule-Openings of the Cannopylea (or Phæodaria)._--The
capsule-membrane of the CANNOPYLEA always possesses only a single large
main-opening or osculum, which lies at the basal pole of the vertical main
axis, and is closed by a circular radiated lid (operculum radiatum). This
operculum appears, when seen from the surface, as a sharply defined
stellate area (astropyle), from the middle of which arises a shorter or
longer cylindrical tube, the proboscis. Hence the PHÆODARIA, like the
MONOPYLEA, belong to the "Merotrypasta" or "Osculosa"; the structure and
significance of the circular operculum, which closes the main-opening
(osculum), are, however, quite different in the two legions. Whilst the
operculum of the MONOPYLEA (porochora) is perforated by numerous fine
vertical pores, and connected with the peculiar internal pseudopodial cone
(podoconus), this structure is entirely wanting in the CANNOPYLEA, and
instead of it there is a solid operculum, with radial ribs which originate
at the base of its central tubular mouth; this tube (proboscis) is
cylindrical, often conical at the base, of very variable length and with a
round aperture at either end. In spite of the great difference which the
various families of CANNOPYLEA exhibit in the formation of their skeleton
and its appendages, the constitution of this characteristic stellate
main-opening (astropyle) is always essentially the same; both the stellate
operculum itself, and the proboscis which rises from its centre, show only
slight differences in the various groups. In addition to this large
main-opening most PHÆODARIA possess several small accessory openings
(parapylæ); and usually two of these are present, placed symmetrically
right and left of the aboral pole of the main axis and in the frontal plane
(Pl. 101, figs. 2, 6, 10; Pl. 104, figs. 1, 2_a_). Sometimes there are more
numerous accessory openings (three to six or more) regularly arranged, as
in the two peculiar families, Circoporida and Tuscarorida; occasionally
also there is only a single parapyle, at the aboral pole of the main axis
(_e.g._, in _Tuscaridium_). The parapylæ seem to be quite absent in the
families Challengerida, Medusettida, Castanellida, and perhaps also in
other PHÆODARIA. The form and structure of the small accessory openings
appear to be always the same. The {xxxii}outer capsule-membrane is elevated
in the form of a short cylindrical tube or "apertural ring" (collare
paraboscidis), the external margin of which bends inwards, and at the base
of the ring passes over into the delicate internal capsule membrane. Upon
this apertural ring is situated a longer or shorter "apertural cone"
(paraboscis), which is a tubular, cylindrical or conical, prolongation of
the membrane, open externally.

  The peculiar capsule-openings of the PHÆODARIA were first discovered and
  carefully described by Hertwig in 1879 (L. N. 33, pp. 95, 107). He found
  in all the six genera which he examined _three_ openings, a main-opening
  at the basal pole of the main axis and two accessory openings, one on
  either side of the apical pole; hence he named the whole group
  "TRIPYLEA." This name, however, is not applicable to the numerous
  PHÆODARIA mentioned above, which have only a main opening without any
  accessory openings, nor to those genera in which the number of the latter
  is variable. I have, therefore, replaced Hertwig's designation by the
  term "CANNOPYLEA," which has reference to the peculiar tubular form of
  the opening. This I find much more developed in many PHÆODARIA than
  Hertwig has represented, and I must also, in certain particulars, dissent
  from his delineation of the minute structure, although this is in the
  main remarkably accurate.


61. _The Nucleus._--The nucleus, enclosed in the central capsule of all
Radiolaria, behaves in every respect like a true cell-nucleus, and thus
lies at the base of the now universal opinion, that the whole Radiolarian
organism, in spite of its varied development and remarkable variations, is
unicellular and remains throughout life a true individual cell. This
important theory is not invalidated by the fact that the nucleus undergoes
peculiar modifications in many groups, and in certain groups presents
appearances seldom or never seen elsewhere.


62. _Uninuclear and Multinuclear Radiolaria (Monocaryotic and
Polycaryotic)._--All Radiolaria present two different conditions in respect
of the behaviour of the nucleus, since in their young stages they are
uninuclear (_monocaryotic_), and in later stages multinuclear
(_polycaryotic_). This is readily explained by the fact that each
individual Radiolarian is developed from a simple unicellular swarm-spore,
and that afterwards, before the formation of swarm-spores, the single
nucleus divides into many small nuclei. Thus in the Radiolaria the nucleus
is pre-eminently the _organ of reproduction and inheritance_. The division
of the originally single nucleus into many small nuclei may take place,
however, at very different periods, so that the Radiolaria may be divided
in this respect into precocious and serotinous.


63. _Serotinous and Precocious Radiolaria._--In the great majority of the
Radiolaria the division of the nucleus takes place only at a late period, a
short time or even immediately before the process of spore formation; it
then breaks up rapidly into numerous small nuclei (always more than one
hundred, sometimes many thousands), and each of these {xxxiii}either
becomes itself the nucleus of a swarm-spore, or by repeated division gives
rise to a group of spore-nuclei. All those Radiolaria which are uninuclear
during the greater part of their existence, and in which the process of
division is late, and takes place rapidly, are called "serotinous" or
late-dividing forms. To this category belong all PHÆODARIA and NASSELLARIA,
as well as all the solitary or monozoic SPUMELLARIA and some ACANTHARIA. On
the other hand, the name "precocious," or early dividing, is applied to
those Radiolaria in which the division of the nucleus takes place very
early, and in which, therefore, the cell is multinuclear during the greater
part of its existence. This is the case in all the social or polyzootic
Radiolaria (Polycyttaria, Pls. 3-8), and also in the great majority of the
ACANTHARIA, both #Acanthometra# and #Acanthophracta#. In the last two
groups, however, there are numerous exceptions, and these are seen in
remarkably large species, characterised by the great size of the central
capsule. From a phylogenetic point of view, the conclusion is allowable
that the precocious forms are secondary, and have arisen by adaptive
modification from the primitive serotinous stem. In the Polycyttaria (or
social SPUMELLARIA, _i.e._, the three families Collozoida, Sphærozoida, and
Collosphærida), the cause of the adaptation lies most probably in the
formation of the colony itself, for all these three families are so closely
related to three corresponding families of serotinous, monozootic
Radiolaria (Thalassicollida, Thalassosphærida, Ethmosphærida), that certain
species of the latter are hardly to be distinguished from isolated
individuals of the former. Perhaps the remarkable formation of the large
central oil-globule, which particularly characterises the Polycyttaria, is
the prime cause of their early nuclear division. In the ACANTHARIA the
cause is most likely to be found in the characteristic _centrogenous
development_ of their acanthin skeleton, whose radial bars first of all
appear in the centre of the capsule. Hence arises directly the excentric
position of the nucleus, which in the archaic stem of ACANTHARIA
(_Actissa?_) was probably central. In any case, but little weight is to be
laid upon the precocious division of the nucleus in the ACANTHARIA in
general, inasmuch as in certain species (both #Acanthometra# and
#Acanthophracta#) the more usual serotinous division persists.


64. _Central and Excentric Nuclei._--The position of the nucleus in the
interior of the central capsule was no doubt primitively central, and this
situation in the geometrical centre of the original spherical central
capsule has been accurately retained in all monozootic SPUMELLARIA; in the
polyzootic families of this legion (Polycyttaria), on the contrary, it is
obscured by the precocious division of the nucleus. In the other three
legions, which may be phylogenetically derived from the SPUMELLARIA, the
position of the nucleus is rarely central, but usually excentric, or at
most subcentral. In the ACANTHARIA (both #Acanthometra# and
#Acanthophracta#) the central position of the nucleus is at once excluded
by the constantly centrogenous development of the skeleton; the nucleus is
therefore always excentric, and may lie at either side; it usually
{xxxiv}divides very early into numerous separate nuclei, which are usually
distributed in the peripheral portions of the central capsule. In the
NASSELLARIA the development of the porochora, and of the podoconus which
stands upon it, brings about the formation of a vertical axis, and in
consequence the central capsule assumes a monaxon form (usually ovoid or
conical); the nucleus then lies in the main axis, but excentrically between
the apex of the podoconus and the aboral pole. In many NASSELLARIA,
however, especially when the podoconus is so large that its apex approaches
the aboral pole of the central capsule, the nucleus is pressed to one side
and lies quite excentrically. The PHÆODARIA exhibit a different
arrangement; the large spheroidal nucleus is always subcentral, so that its
main axis corresponds with that of the concentric spheroidal central
capsule; but since the astropyle always occupies the oral pole of the
latter, and since the distance of the nucleus from this pole is always
somewhat different from its distance from the other, it follows that,
strictly speaking, the nucleus never lies accurately in the geometrical
centre.


65. _Homogeneous and Allogeneous Nuclei._--The nucleus of the Radiolaria
not only exhibits a similar structure and composition, and suffers similar
modifications to those which are found to occur in the case of other
cell-nuclei, but also to some extent shows very peculiar developmental
forms, which are seldom or never found in other cells. In the first place
the nuclei may be divided into homogeneous and allogeneous, the former are
structureless and consist of a uniform mass of nuclein, whilst the latter
are composed of different substances and show various structural relations.
_Homogeneous_ nuclei, whose whole mass is uniform and exhibits no
structural differentiation, are probably always to be found in the
swarm-spores; in the fully developed Radiolarian body they are found only
in the first legion, SPUMELLARIA, and that both in many Monozoa (especially
small #Sphæroidea# and #Prunoidea#) and in the Polyzoa (or Polycyttaria).
The whole mass of these homogeneous nuclei, which are usually spherical or
ellipsoidal, consists of uniform, perfectly clear and transparent nuclein,
and becomes evenly stained by carmine, hæmatoxyline, &c.  They may be
readily distinguished by these means from the clear vacuoles or "hyaline
vesicles," which are evenly distributed in the endoplasm of many
Radiolaria, and may be confused with the former. _Allogeneous_ nuclei,
which are always composed of different parts and often show complicated
structural relations, are found developed in the great majority of
Radiolaria. The most important differentiation exhibited by these secondary
forms is the separation of the nuclear mass into a firm nuclear substance
(caryoplasm) and a fluid nuclear juice (caryolymph). In addition in each
nucleus a nucleolus is visible, and often several or many may be seen (see
§§ 67 to 70).


66. _The Form of the Nucleus._--The nucleus of the Radiolaria shows greater
variations in form and structure than are to be found in the majority of
cell-nuclei; {xxxv}exception must, however, be made in the case of many
animal ovicells, which, in their peculiar form and composition, often
recall large Radiolarian nuclei. With respect to the external shape two
main forms may be distinguished, as primary and secondary. The _primary
form_ of the Radiolarian nucleus is the sphere; it occurs not only in most
swarm-spores, but also in most adult forms belonging to the legion
SPUMELLARIA, and in individual instances in other groups; indeed the nuclei
of most SPUMELLARIA, as also the concentric central capsules in which they
lie, are true geometrical spheres. The _secondary forms_ of the nucleus are
found in the majority of adult Radiolaria, and arise from the primary
spherical forms in various ways, either by the elongation or contraction of
one axis, or by the formation of apophyses or processes. The most important
of these secondary forms are as follows:--

  1. _Ellipsoidal nuclei_, arising by elongation of one principal axis;
  very common among the NASSELLARIA, as well as in many #Prunoidea# and
  #Larcoidea# among the SPUMELLARIA; also in several ACANTHARIA.

  2. _Discoidal nuclei_, arising by contraction of one principal axis,
  sometimes lenticular or spheroidal, biconvex, sometimes shaped like a
  disc or coin; especially common in the #Discoidea# among the SPUMELLARIA,
  also in some ACANTHARIA; the large nucleus of the PHÆODARIA is always
  spheroidal or almost spherical, with a slightly shortened main axis.

  3. _Stellate nuclei_, spherical, and armed with evenly distributed radial
  club-shaped or conical processes; rare but very characteristic,
  especially in the two large Thalassicollida _Thalassopila_ (Pl. 1, fig.
  3), and _Thalassophysa_ (Monogr. d. Radiol., Taf. i.); also in some
  #Sphærellaria# (Pl. 11, fig. 5).

  4. _Amoeboid nuclei_, with unequal processes irregularly arranged, in
  certain irregular forms of SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA.

  5. _Lobate nuclei_, with several (usually two or three) large ovoid or
  pyriform lobes, which protrude into corresponding larger lobes of the
  central capsule, in many NASSELLARIA, especially the multiarticulate
  #Cyrtoidea# (Pl. 59, figs. 12, 13). The budding nucleus of the ACANTHARIA
  is also lobate (Pl. 129, figs. 6-11).


67. _The Nucleus of the Peripylea._--The nucleus of the SPUMELLARIA or
PERIPYLEA shows in certain groups a very primitive arrangement, indeed the
archaic structure from which the various forms of nuclei of other
Radiolaria may be derived; but on the other hand, in other groups it
exhibits very peculiar and remarkable differentiations. In the first place
it may be noted that the monozootic or solitary SPUMELLARIA usually possess
a single serotinous nucleus, which only divides into numerous swarm-spores
at a late period; {xxxvi}whilst, on the contrary, the polyzootic colonial
SPUMELLARIA (or Polycyttaria) are uninuclear only in the young state (Pl.
3, fig. 12), and speedily present numerous small homogeneous nuclei, which
have arisen by precocious division of a single nucleus; these are usually
spherical and 0.008 to 0.012 mm. in diameter. The serotinous nucleus of the
monozootic SPUMELLARIA, in many divisions of this large legion, and
especially in the simply constituted #Sphæroidea#, is a homogeneous sphere
of nuclein, lying in the middle of the central capsule. In many other cases
it assumes the form of a spherical vesicle ("Binnen-Bläschen"), whose fluid
or semi-fluid contents are enclosed by a more or less firm membrane. This
vesicle often contains a single central spherical _nucleolus_ (Pl. 1, figs.
1_l_, 4_l_), but sometimes a variable number of small excentric nucleoli
(Pl. 1, figs. 1_a_, 2_a_). The nuclear membrane is often somewhat thick,
presenting a double contour, and in such cases may even exhibit a fine
radial striation, the expression of minute pores (Pl. 1, fig. 2_a_). In the
colossal nuclei (as much as 1 to 2 mm. in diameter) of certain large
Thalassicollida the nucleolus presents a very remarkable form, becoming
stellate by the protrusion of processes, which may again branch in a
dendritic fashion (as in the common _Thalassicolla nucleata_), or it may
develop into a very long cylindrical thread, which is disposed in
serpentine coils, and in _Thalassophysa pelagica_ passes into the different
cæcal processes of the stellate nucleus. In many #Sphæroidea#, whose
skeleton is composed of numerous concentric lattice spheres, the small
central spherical nucleus lies at first within the innermost of these (the
medullary shell); but afterwards it grows through the meshes of the
lattice-work, and the radiating club-shaped processes thus formed (Pl. 11,
fig. 5) unite with each other outside the medullary shell, and form an
external nuclear sphere which completely encloses the latter. In the
Polysphærida (with several concentric lattice-shells) and in the
Spongosphærida (with spongy lattice-spheres), this process may be several
times repeated, so that eventually the central spherical nucleus attains
considerable dimensions, and encloses two or more concentric lattice-shells
with their radial connecting rods. The nuclear membrane is in these cases
usually penetrated by radial bars, which connect the outermost of the
enclosed shells with the remaining cortical shells which surround the
central capsule. The same remarkable arrangement is also very common among
the #Discoidea#. The small spherical primary nucleus is in such instances
immediately surrounded by the innermost earliest developed lattice-shell,
around which the concentric rings are subsequently deposited; it then grows
out through the meshes, and the processes fuse outside the ring to form a
homogeneous lentiform nucleus (Pl. 43, fig. 15). The same process recurs in
certain #Prunoidea# and #Larcoidea#, whilst in other SPUMELLARIA of these
groups (_e.g._, Pylonida) the lobate processes of the nucleus remain free.

  Both the simple serotinous nucleus of the monozootic SPUMELLARIA, and the
  numerous precocious nuclei of the Polycyttaria, were first described in
  my Monograph in 1862, the former as the "endocyst" ("Binnen-Bläschen"),
  the latter as "spherical transparent vesicles" ("Kugelige
  {xxxvii}wasserhelle Bläschen"). I was in error, however, in regarding the
  latter as identical with the so-called "hyaline spherules" in the central
  capsule of many Monozoa, which rather belong to the category of
  intracapsular vacuoles (see § 72). The credit of recognising, by the aid
  of the modern methods of staining, the distinctness of these two
  structures, which may readily be mistaken for each other, and of
  demonstrating the true nature both of the serotinous and precocious
  nuclei, belongs to Richard Hertwig (1879, L. N. 33).


68. _The Nucleus of the Actipylea._--The nucleus of the ACANTHARIA or
ACTIPYLEA shows very peculiar relations in respect of structure and
division, particularly special forms of lobular budding, which belong to
the characteristic peculiarities of this singular legion, and are not found
among other Radiolaria. The position of the nucleus is _always excentric_,
even in the youngest ACANTHARIA, for the centrogeneous formation of the
skeleton, the constant development of the earliest radial portions of it in
the middle of the central capsule, forces the nucleus from its normal
central position. The majority of the ACANTHARIA, like most Polycyttaria,
are precocious, the primary nucleus early dividing into numerous small
nuclei (see note A below). Nevertheless there are many exceptions to this
rule in different families, _e.g._, _Stauracantha_, _Xiphacantha_,
_Phatnacantha_, and _Pristacantha_ among the #Acanthometra#, and
_Stauraspis_, _Echinaspis_, _Dodecaspis_, and _Phatnaspis_ among the
#Acanthophracta#. In these instances the primary nucleus remains for a long
time as a simple excentric ellipsoidal or irregularly round body, even in
the fully developed stage, and only at a very late period (sometimes just
before the formation of the spores) divides into many small nuclei. Since
this serotinous division of the nucleus takes place in different genera of
very various groups, it can only be decided by further investigations how
widely it is spread among the ACANTHARIA, and upon what circumstances it is
dependent (see note B). The division of the nucleus appears to be
precocious in the majority of this legion, and a number of small nuclei
appear to be early formed by a peculiar process of budding; in most fully
developed ACANTHARIA these are disposed in one or two layers under the
surface of the central capsule, but if their numbers increase to any
considerable extent, the whole space between the skeletal rods becomes
filled with small nuclei; sometimes these are homogeneous, sometimes
vesicular, 0.002 to 0.012 mm. in diameter; usually they are spherical and
have a small nucleolus (compare Pl. 129, figs. 6-11, and note C).

  A.  The numerous nuclei, which are to be found in the central capsule of
  most mature ACANTHARIA, were first described in my Monograph (1862) as
  "spherical, transparent vesicles, provided with a small dark granule" (p.
  374, Taf. xv. figs. 2, 5; Taf. xvi. figs. 2, 4; Taf. xxi. fig. 7, &c.).
  Their more minute constitution and peculiar origin were first accurately
  delineated by R. Hertwig (1879, _loc. cit._, pp. 11-24, Taf. i-iii.).

  B. The fact that in a number of ACANTHARIA the nucleus does not divide
  early as in the majority of the legion, but only at a later period, was
  first observed by R. Hertwig in a species of #Acanthometra# (_Xiphacantha
  serrata_), and a species of #Acanthophracta# (_Phatnaspis
  {xxxviii}mülleri_ = _Haliommatidium mülleri_) (_loc. cit._, pp. 11 and
  27). This serotinous division of the nucleus seems, however, to be rather
  widely spread in both sublegions of the ACANTHARIA; I have found, not
  only in the forms above mentioned, but also in several others belonging
  to different genera, a single large excentric nucleus, even in those
  individuals in which the skeleton was fully developed.

  C. The peculiar mode of nuclear budding, by which these small nuclei
  arise, appears to proceed in the following manner (Pl. 129). The
  vesicular primary nucleus, which, in consequence of the centrogeneous
  development of the skeleton protrudes as it grows into irregular lobes
  (Pl. 129, fig. 9), assumes a peculiar concavo-convex form, sometimes that
  of a hood or dish, sometimes that of a kidney or sausage. The convex
  surface is apposed to the capsule-membrane, while the concave is turned
  towards the central star of the skeleton (fig. 6). There is now formed at
  the centre of the convex surface of the strong, doubly-contoured, nuclear
  membrane, a flask-shaped invagination with a narrow neck and expanded
  base; the membrane now becomes disposed in peculiar folds, which at the
  narrow aperture of invagination appear as folds, but on the expanded body
  of the flask take the form of concentric rings, laid closely side by side
  (Pl. 129, fig. 10). The convex bottom of the flask, which is directed
  towards the concave proximal side of the nucleus, becomes again
  invaginated by a central conical apophysis of the enlarged nucleolus,
  which is situated between them. Usually the nucleolus has already become
  flattened into a lentiform shape, and upon its distal face a conical
  apophysis has been developed, which is divisible into a darker proximal
  and clearer distal portion. The tip of the latter appears to be in direct
  connection with the nuclear membrane at the centre of the base of the
  flask-shaped invagination (figs. 6, 10). At this stage of development the
  nucleus of the ACANTHARIA generally presents the characteristic form of a
  hood-shaped, concavo-convex vesicle, whose radial axis is also the axis
  of the flask-shaped distal invagination, and of the depressed conical
  nucleolus, which lies between the latter and the concave side of the
  nucleus.  After this peculiar invagination has persisted for some time in
  connection with the enlarged nucleolus, both disappear, and then a
  remarkable growth of lobular processes takes place on the concave
  proximal side of the hood or kidney-shaped nucleus; from four to eight
  knobs of unequal size usually appear, and their thickened wall encloses a
  variable number of small of nucleoli; these are at first few but
  afterwards more numerous (fig. 7). Subsequently these knobs or lobes
  become completely separated by constriction from the original central
  mass of the nucleus, and appear as so many separate independent
  "sausage-shaped bodies" in the hollow central capsule (fig. 8). Each of
  the bodies now appears, and at first on its convex aspect, to form a
  large number of small nucleoli, which either separate by constriction
  from it or become free by its breaking up and lie in numbers in the
  central capsule. Finally the buds or lobes of the nucleus break up
  entirely into such nucleoli, which are evenly distributed in the central
  capsule, and become the nuclei of the swarm-spores (fig. 11). Compare R.
  Hertwig, L. N. 33, Taf. i.-iii. pp. 19-25.


69. _The Nucleus of the Monopylea._--The nucleus of the mature forms of the
NASSELLARIA or MONOPYLEA is generally simple or lobate, homogeneous or
vesicular and _excentric_, and appears only to divide into numerous small
nuclei just before the formation of the spores. Nevertheless I have
sometimes, though not often, seen in representatives of very various
families of the MONOPYLEA, the central capsule filled with many small
spherical homogeneous nuclei (Pl. 53, fig. 19). Hence all the families of
this legion appear to be serotinous, their simple primitive nucleus
persisting for a long period. It {xxxix}is commonly placed excentrically,
and most usually in the apical or aboral portion of the central capsule,
either between its apex and the podoconus, or quite excentrically on the
dorsal aspect. The simple nucleus of the NASSELLARIA usually appears to be
vesicular and to possess a somewhat firm membrane, clear contents, and a
rather large, dark coloured nucleolus. In many NASSELLARIA the nucleus is
spherical or ellipsoidal (Pl. 53, fig. 11); whilst in many #Stephoidea# and
#Spyroidea#, where the central capsule is constricted by the sagittal ring
and divided into two symmetrical lateral lobes, the nucleus partakes of the
same mode of growth and appears in the middle of the capsule as a
transversely placed ellipsoid or even as a short cylinder (Pl. 90, figs. 7,
9). The most remarkable modification in the form of the nucleus is to be
found in the multi-articulate #Cyrtoidea#. Here it is usually enclosed in
the cephalis and is spherical, ellipsoidal or spheroidal, often flattened
almost into a disc. If now the central capsule increase greatly in size and
put forth three or four clavate lobes which hang down through the pores of
the cortinar septum into the thorax (or even into the succeeding joints),
the nucleus usually undergoes similar modification, and three or four
finger-like apophyses are developed from its base, which project into the
corresponding lobes of the central capsule (Pl. 59, figs. 4, 12, 13).

  The numerous small, spherical, homogeneous nuclei which are to be found
  in the central capsules of those NASSELLARIA, which are ripe and about to
  develop spores, were described in 1862 in my Monograph, as "numerous,
  small, transparent, spherical cells" in the case of various #Cyrtoidea#
  (_Arachnocorys_, _Lithomelissa_, _Eucecryphalus_, _Eucyrtidium_, &c.)
  (_loc. cit._, pp. 302, 305, 309, 321, &c.), and I find them of the same
  form and dimensions, but deeply stained with carmine in many preparations
  in the Challenger collection. R. Hertwig has delineated them very
  accurately in the case of _Tridictyopus_ (1879, _loc. cit._, p. 84, Taf.
  vii. fig. 3). He was also the first to recognise the uninucleate
  condition of the NASSELLARIA, which is much more frequently observed than
  the serotinous multinucleate condition, and he described very clearly the
  peculiar lobed nuclei which arise in #Cyrtoidea#, owing to the protrusion
  of the nucleus through the cortinar septum (_loc. cit._, p. 85, Taf.
  viii. figs. 3-8).


70. _The Nucleus of the Cannopylea._--The nucleus presents the same
remarkable structures in all species of the PHÆODARIA or CANNOPYLEA which
have been examined, and closely resembles the germinal vesicle of an
amphibian ovum, being a large spherical or spheroidal vesicle with numerous
nucleoli. Its diameter usually amounts to half or two-thirds, sometimes
even three-quarters, that of the central capsule. The vertical main axis of
the latter is also that of the nucleus, which usually lies somewhat nearer
to the aboral pole. The nucleus is generally rather more strongly
compressed in the direction of the main axis than the capsule itself. The
membrane of the vesicular nucleus is thin, but firm, and encloses a clear
or finely granular mass of nuclein. The number and size of the contained
nucleoli are variable even in one and the same species, and stand in
inverse ratio to each other, an obvious result of the gradual process of
division. Commonly {xl}from twenty to fifty roundish or spherical, strongly
refracting nucleoli, are present; more rarely there are several hundred
very small ones.  Sometimes the nucleus is penetrated by fine trabeculæ, in
whose meshes lie the nucleoli (Pl. 101, fig. 2). In certain nuclei, which
contained a few large nucleoli, these were of irregular form, probably the
result of amoeboid movements (Pl. 101, fig. 1). In the formation of spores
in the CANNOPYLEA, the nucleus apparently becomes dissolved, and its
numerous nucleoli develop directly into the nuclei or mother-nuclei, which
produce the nuclei of the flagellate spores. Furthermore, many PHÆODARIA
seem to multiply by simple cell-division, since very commonly (especially
in the #Phæocystina# and #Phæoconchia#) two large nuclei (right and left),
may be met with in one central capsule; sometimes also a single large
nucleus, in which a sagittal constriction marks the commencing division of
the capsule (Pl. 101, figs. 2, 36; Pl. 104, fig. 3; Pl. 124, fig. 6, &c.).

  The large nucleus of the PHÆODARIA was first described in my Monograph in
  1862, in the case of _Aulacantha_ (p. 263), _Aulosphæra_ (p. 359), and
  _Coelodendrum_ (p. 361), as a "large, spherical, thin-walled endocyst,"
  from 0.1 to 0.2 mm. in diameter. More detailed descriptions, especially
  with respect to the behaviour of the nucleoli were given by R. Hertwig in
  1879 (L. N. 33, p. 97).


71. _The Endoplasm or Intracapsular Protoplasm._--In all Radiolaria the
intracapsular protoplasm, which, for the sake of brevity, may be termed
"endoplasm," constitutes originally, and especially in the earliest stages,
the only important content of the central capsule, except the nucleus. In
certain SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, of simple structure and of small
dimensions, this condition persists for a long period, and the endoplasm
then appears as a homogeneous, colourless, turbid or finely granular,
mucous, semi-solid mass, which cannot be distinguished from the ordinary
undifferentiated protoplasm of young cells; no definite structure, and in
particular, no fibrillar network, can be discovered in it even by the use
of the customary reagents. In the great majority of the Radiolaria,
however, this primitive homogeneous condition of the endoplasm is very
transient, and it soon undergoes definite modifications, becoming
differentiated into separate parts or producing new constituent contents.
Such products of the internal protoplasm are in particular hyaline spheres
(vacuoles and alveoles), oil-globules, pigment-bodies, crystals, &c. The
most important of the differentiations which take place in the endoplasm is
that into an internal, granular, _medullary_ substance and an external,
fibrillar, _cortical_ substance; although the various legions behave
somewhat differently in this respect (§§ 77-80).


72. _Intracapsular Hyaline Spheres._--The central capsule of very many
Radiolaria contains in its endoplasm numerous spherical bodies of varying
size, which consist of watery or albuminous fluid, and have previously been
regarded as nuclei, or described as products of the internal protoplasm,
under various names, such as "spherical transparent {xli}vesicles" (see
note A, below), "albumen spheres" (see B), "gelatinous spheres" (see C),
"alveolar cells" (see D), &c. Some of these spheres are perfectly
transparent, structureless and of varying refractive power, producing the
impression of drops of fluid; others contain various formed constituents,
such as oil-globules, fat-granules, pigment-granules, concretions,
crystals, &c. From a morphological point of view they may all be divided
into two categories, membraneless vacuoles and vesicular alveoles.  The
_vacuoles_ are simple spherical drops of fluid or of gelatinous material,
devoid of a special envelope, but immediately surrounded by the endoplasm.
The _alveoles_, on the other hand, are true vesicles with a thin spherical
envelope, enclosing a drop of fluid or jelly. This envelope is commonly
very thin, homogeneous, and often scarcely discernible, so that in practice
a sharp line of demarcation cannot be drawn between alveoles and vacuoles;
the former are usually somewhat larger than the latter. The fact is,
nevertheless, certain that the hyaline spheres, which may be isolated on
rupturing the central capsule of many Radiolaria, in certain cases,
particularly in large species, possess a clear, anatomically demonstrable
membrane, whilst in others no such appearance is presented.  It may be
assumed that the vesicular alveoles are developed from the drop-like
vacuoles by increase in size, and by the precipitation of a delicate
envelope from the endoplasm. The character common to all these hyaline
spheres, whether vacuoles or alveoles, is found in their aqueous, not
adipose, constitution, and in their clear transparent appearance, which
allows of no structure (the above-mentioned contained bodies excepted)
being recognised. Their refractive power and consistency vary somewhat, and
probably their chemical constitution still more. Sometimes they are
strongly refractive and shining, and sometimes feebly refractive and pale;
their consistency shows all intermediate stages between a thin fluid, which
readily disappears in water, and a firm, insoluble jelly. As regards their
chemical composition (which is probably very variable), the hyaline spheres
may be best divided into two groups, the organic and inorganic. The
_inorganic hyaline spheres_ are simple drops of saline solution without any
carbonaceous constituent; the _organic_, on the other hand, contain a small
quantity of organic matter dissolved in the watery fluid, and may be either
albuminous or gelatinous spheres.  The formed contents which are commonly
present are of very various natures, usually small fat-granules, more
rarely larger fat-granules or pigment-granules, sometimes concretions or
crystals. In many groups, especially among the large PHÆODARIA and
#Collodaria#, the numerous hyaline spheres are remarkable for their equal
size and even distribution throughout the endoplasm (Pl. 1, figs. 1, 4; Pl.
104, fig. 2, &c.). In some genera belonging to the Thalassicollida the
alveoles are of enormous size (Pl. 1,  figs. 2, 3); they then become
flattened by mutual pressure into polyhedra and distend the central capsule
to unusual dimensions (in _Physematium_ and _Thalassolampe_ 8 to 12 mm.).

  A. The "_spherical hyaline vesicles_,"  which I described in my Monograph
  (1862, p. 71) as among the most important and constant contents of the
  central capsule, are partly vacuoles, {xlii}partly homogeneous nuclei.
  Most recent investigators, Bütschli in particular (1882, L. N. 41), have
  pointed out and rightly criticised this confusion. The criticism might,
  however, have been more justly expressed by stating that, in the
  preparation of my Monograph (1859-1862), I did not make use of modern
  methods of demonstrating the nucleus by staining fluids, which were quite
  unknown at the time, and only discovered a decade later. In fact, without
  the aid of such reagents, it is quite impossible to distinguish between
  the various "spherical transparent vesicles," of which those found in the
  central capsule of the PHÆODARIA and many monozootic #Collodaria# are
  simple vacuoles lying in the endoplasm, whilst, on the other hand, those
  of the Polycyttaria and many other Radiolaria are true homogeneous
  nuclei. For not only are the general appearance of the small clear
  spheres, their refractive power, and regular distribution in the
  endoplasm quite similar, but they are also of much the same size, for the
  diameter ranges from 0.005 to 0.015 mm., being generally between 0.008
  and 0.012 mm. In addition to this there is generally in each hyaline
  sphere a dark brightly shining granule, which, in the case of the
  vacuole, is simply a fat-granule, whilst in the case of the nucleus, it
  is a true nucleolus. The small hyaline spheres in the young uninucleate
  capsules of the Polycyttaria are simple vacuoles (Pl. 3, fig. 12), whilst
  in the ripe multinucleate capsules they are true nuclei (Pl. 3, figs. 3,
  8, 9), and it is quite impossible to discriminate between these two
  conditions without the use of reagents. This has been expressly
  recognised by R. Hertwig, who has the merit of having been the first to
  clearly distinguish, by the aid of staining fluids, between these two
  different constituents (1879, L. N. 33, p. 108).

  B. The "_albumen spheres_," which were first observed by A. Schneider in
  1858 in the common cosmopolitan _Thalassicolla nucleata_ (L. N. 13, p.
  40), and which appear to occur in only a few other Thalassicollida, are
  distinguished from the ordinary hyaline spheres of about the same size by
  their higher refractive power and by certain albuminoid reactions,
  especially the coagulation of a membranous envelope under the influence
  of certain reagents (see my Monograph, p. 250, and Hertwig, L. N. 26,
  1876, p. 46). They often enclose various formed contents, and require
  further investigation.

  C. The _gelatinous spheres_ of various sizes, found in the endoplasm of
  the Radiolaria, agree in their reactions (especially in staining by
  certain reagents) with the common extracapsular jelly of the calymma, and
  are hence distinguishable both from the true (coagulable) "albumen
  sphere," and from the ordinary watery vacuoles.

  D. The _alveoles_, which are only accurately known in the case of certain
  large monozootic #Collodaria#, but which also seem to occur in the
  central capsule of other remarkably large Radiolaria, were described in
  my Monograph in the case of _Thalassolampe margarodes_ and _Physematium
  mülleri_, under the name "intracapsular alveolar cells" (1862, pp. 77,
  254, 257). They are not, however, true nucleated cells, and the body
  described as a nucleus is not such in reality. Nevertheless these large
  hyaline spheres do possess a special envelope, as I have recently
  convinced myself by the examination of ruptured central capsules of
  _Thalassolampe maxima_, _Thalassopila cladococcus_, and _Physematium
  atlanticum_ (Pl. 1, figs. 2, 3). The central capsule of these
  #Collodaria# becomes distended to most unusual dimensions (2 to 12 mm. in
  diameter) by the great development of these large hyaline vesicles, each
  of which measure from 0.1 to 0.5 mm. in diameter.


73. _The Intracapsular Fat-Globules._--Fat is present in the central
capsule of all Radiolaria in larger or smaller quantities, and generally
appears in the form of very {xliii}numerous, small, spherical granules,
which are either distributed evenly in the endoplasm (as an emulsion) or
enclosed in the vacuoles; the latter, in particular, is the case in most
PHÆODARIA, perhaps generally. In this group each vacuole contains as a rule
a single dark, shining fat-granule, and sometimes also an irregular bunch
composed of from two to five or more granules. In addition to these small
fat-granules (_granula adiposa_) which are always present, the central
capsule of many Radiolaria contains also larger fat-globules (_globuli
adiposi_). These appear to be generally wanting in the PHÆODARIA, and are
on the whole rare in the ACANTHARIA; whilst, on the contrary, they are very
common in the NASSELLARIA and SPUMELLARIA. The Polycyttaria or social
Radiolaria are as a rule distinguished by the possession of a single large
central oil-globule, which lies in the centre of the central capsule, and
is on an average about one-third of it in diameter (Pl. 3, figs. 4, 5).
This is absent, however, in those young capsules of the Polycyttaria in
which the primary nucleus is centrally situated (Pl. 3, fig. 12). Those
species of Polycyttaria whose central capsule reaches a considerable size,
often enclose numerous oil-globules, and in _Collophidium_ (species of
_Collozoum_ with an elongated cylindrical capsule, Pl. 3, figs. 1, 3) the
axis of each capsule is occupied by a row of numerous oil-globules.  In the
monozootic SPUMELLARIA, in which the nucleus is always centrally situated,
the large oil-globules are, of course, excentric, being in apposition to
the inner surface of the capsule-membrane (Pl. 1, fig. 3; Pl. 2, figs. 2,
5). In the #Discoidea# the oil-globules, which are often present in large
numbers, form elegant concentric rings around the central nucleus, and in
those species with segmented arms, there are one or more transverse rows in
each segment (Pl. 43, fig. 15). In the NASSELLARIA the number and
distribution of the oil-globules are dependent upon the form of the central
capsule. When this is simple, without lobes, and ovoid or conical, they
generally lie in its aboral half above the podoconus (Pl. 51, figs. 5, 13;
Pl. 97, fig. 1). When, on the contrary, the basal portion of the capsule
sends out three or four dependent processes (as in the majority of the
#Cyrtoidea#), a large globule may generally be seen in the swollen distal
part of each conical or ovoid lobe (Pl. 53, fig. 19; Pl. 60, figs. 4-7). In
many #Stephoidea# and #Spyroidea#, whose central capsule is separated into
two lateral portions by the constriction corresponding to the sagittal
ring, each of these contains either a single large globule or a group of
small ones (Pl. 90, figs. 7, 10). These oil-globules are usually colourless
and highly refractive; rarely they are yellow or brown, sometimes
rose-coloured, or an intense blood-red (_e.g._, in _Thalassophysa
sanguinolenta_) or even orange (in _Physematium mülleri_). In many
SPUMELLARIA, and particularly in the Polycyttaria, an albuminous substratum
may be recognised in them, which is sometimes disposed in layers, and after
extraction of the fat presents the appearance of a laminated sphere. The
physiological significance of the oil-globules is twofold; in the first
place they tend to diminish the specific gravity of the organism; in the
second they may be utilised as a reserve store {xliv}of nutriment. In the
latter respect they are of special importance in the process of
spore-formation, each flagellate spore usually containing a fat-granule.


74. _The Intracapsular Pigment-Bodies._--In the majority of Radiolaria when
observed alive, the central capsule is coloured, only in the minority is it
colourless.  The colour is never diffuse, but always due to the formation
of definite pigment granules or vesicles, which are sometimes distributed
evenly throughout the endoplasm, sometimes aggregated in the central or
peripheral regions.  Their form may be either spherical, irregularly
rounded, or polyhedral.  They vary much in dimensions, but in most cases
are immeasurably small, and appear under a high magnifying power as fine
dust; occasionally, however, their diameter may amount to from 0.001 to
0.005 or more. The chemical constitution of the intracapsular pigment is
unknown in most Radiolaria, and is probably very various. In many instances
the pigment-granules consist of fat, in others not.  The commonest colours
are yellow, red, and brown; violet and blue are rare, and green still
rarer. Sometimes a definite tone of colour prevails throughout a whole
group, and may then be attributed to inheritance, _e.g._, red is found in
most #Sphæroidea#, and blue in the Polycyttaria (see note A). One colour is
almost always constant in the members of the same species. True
pigment-cells, belonging to the Radiolarian organism, do not occur within
the central capsule. The peculiar yellow cells which are found in the
central capsule of many ACANTHARIA are symbiotic xanthellæ (see § 76).

  A. The number of Radiolaria whose pigment has been examined in the living
  state, is too small to allow of any general conclusions being drawn.
  Regarding the different colours known, see my Monograph, L. N. 16, p. 76.


75. _The Intracapsular Crystals._--The crystals found in the central
capsule of many Radiolaria may be divided into two groups, of very
different significance; small crystals, which are very widely distributed,
and large crystals, which occur in only a few genera. The _small crystals_
may also be termed "spore-crystals," since each swarm-spore often contains
such a crystal. They are rod-like or spindle-shaped, and consist of an
organic substance which probably serves as a reserve of nutriment for the
developing spores. Such spore-crystals have been observed in numerous
SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA belonging to various families, and are probably
present throughout the two legions which make up the Porulosa. On the other
hand, they have not been noticed in the Osculosa (NASSELLARIA and
PHÆODARIA), the few swarm-spores belonging to these groups which have been
observed not exhibiting any crystals. The _large crystals_, which occur in
small numbers in the endoplasm, have hitherto only been observed in a few
species of SPUMELLARIA, belonging to the Polycyttaria. They were first
noticed in the common _Collosphæra huxleyi_, and regarded as coelestin.
They are also found in the central capsule of many other Collosphærida,
_e.g._, _Buccinosphæra_ (Pl. 5, figs. 11, 12). Crystal-masses,
crystal-sheaves, or spherical masses of radiating acicular crystals are
enclosed in {xlv}the vacuoles or "albumen globules" of _Thalassicola
nucleata_ and other Thalassicollida, as well as in the central capsule of
_Coelographis_ and some other PHÆODARIA (Pl. 127, figs. 4-7). All these
large crystals are probably to be regarded as excretory products.


75A. _The Intracapsular Concrements._--Concretions, either mineral or
organic, of varying form and constitution, are to be found in the endoplasm
of Radiolaria belonging to very different families. They are most abundant
and multiform in _Thalassicolla nucleata_, being usually circular or
elliptical discs, which are concentrically laminated and highly refractive,
resembling starch-grains. Among them twin forms may frequently be observed,
as though the concrements were in process of division (see note A). Similar
amyloid concretions are to be seen in the central capsule of different
SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, _e.g._, in _Cephalospyris triangulata_ (Pl.
96, fig. 28). Violin-shaped, highly refractive concrements have been
observed in the central capsule of numerous SPUMELLARIA, NASSELLARIA, and
ACANTHARIA, _e.g._, _Thalassosphæra_, _Spongosphæra_, _Plegmosphæra_,
_Cyrtocalpis_, _Peripyramis_, _Botryocella_, &c. (see note B). The chemical
constitution of these concrements is insufficiently known.

  A. The amyloid concretions of _Thalassicolla nucleata_ have been
  described in detail in my Monograph (pp. 80, 250, Taf. iii. figs. 2, 3),
  and by R. Hertwig in the Histologie der Radiolarien (1876, p. 47, Taf.
  iii. figs. 9-13).

  B. The violin-shaped concretions of _Thalassosphæra bifurca_ have been
  figured in my Monograph (pp. 80, 261, Taf. xii. fig. 1).


76. _The Intracapsular Xanthellæ._--The xanthellæ, zooxanthellæ, or
symbiotic "yellow cells" are found within the central capsule only in the
ACANTHARIA, whilst in other Radiolaria they only occur in the
extracapsulum. They are most frequent in the #Acanthometra#, rarer in the
#Acanthophracta#, but even in the former they are often wanting. Their
number is very variable, but usually small, from ten to thirty in one
capsule. They lie for the most part immediately below the capsule membrane,
in the cortical layer of the endoplasm. The form of the yellow cells is
either spherical or ellipsoidal, often also spheroidal or even lentiform.
The diameter varies from 0.01 to 0.03 mm. They possess a distinct membrane
and an excentric nucleus, and contain numerous yellow pigment-granules in
the endoplasm. This yellow pigment dissolves in mineral acids to form a
green fluid, and in other respects also behaves somewhat differently from
the yellow pigment in the extracapsular yellow cells of the SPUMELLARIA and
NASSELLARIA. In both cases, however, the xanthellæ are not integral
portions of the organism, but unicellular algae, living as parasites or
symbiontes in the body.

  A. The yellow cells in the central capsule of the ACANTHARIA were first
  observed by Joh. Müller (L. N. 12, pp. 14, 47). In my Monograph I
  described them at greater length, and indicated their differences from
  the extracapsular yellow cells of other Radiolaria (L. N. 16, pp. 77,
  86). Since then, R. Hertwig has demonstrated their cellular nature (L. N.
  33, pp. 12, 113), and still more recently {xlvi}Brandt has given further
  accurate information regarding their occurrence, constitution, and
  physiological significance (L. N. 39, ii. Art., p. 235, figs. 62-73).


77. _The Endoplasm of the Peripylea._--The intracapsular protoplasm of the
SPUMELLARIA or PERIPYLEA is usually distinguished by a more or less
complete radial arrangement, which does not occur in the same form in other
Radiolaria; it may be regarded as characteristic of this legion, for it
probably occurs in all the species at some period of life or other, and
stands in a direct causal relationship with the typical structure of the
capsule-membrane in all the "PERIPYLEA" (see note A). For as this is
commonly perforated by very numerous pores distributed at equal intervals
over the whole surface of the capsule, and since a communication between
the intra- and extracapsular sarcode takes place through these, the radiate
structure of the endoplasm may be readily explained as due to the influence
of radial currents which take place continuously or intermittently in the
endoplasm. This radiate structure is most obvious when the endoplasm
contains no secondary products or only an insignificant amount of these,
and thus appears colourless and almost homogeneous, or only finely
granular. Under these circumstances, an optical section of the central
capsule usually reveals a distinct radial striation; numerous narrow,
straight, dark streaks alternating regularly with still narrower clear
ones; the latter consist of homogeneous, the former of more or less
granular protoplasm (Pl. 20, fig. 1_a_). Often there may be distinguished
in each darker streak a single straight row of strongly refracting (fat?)
granules, sometimes several such rows. Occasionally the whole endoplasm
becomes divided up into a number of large "radial wedges," club-shaped,
conical or pyramidal masses of granular protoplasm, separated by clear
divisions of hyaline plasma (_e.g._, in _Actissa radiata_, p. 14, where in
the optical section of the central capsule, between the membrane and the
nucleus, twenty-five dark radial wedges of equal size were separated by
thick clear partitions of hyaline protoplasm). In the majority of the
SPUMELLARIA this radial striation is partially or entirely concealed by the
formation of pigment or of other products. Very often it is only visible in
the cortical layer, which lies immediately below the capsule-membrane (Pl.
1, figs. 1, 3). The remarkable "centripetal cones" which characterise the
Thalassicollid genus _Physematium_, and were formerly described as
"centripetal cell-groups," are probably a special development of these
cortical radial wedges; they are conical cortical bodies, regularly
distributed on the inner surface of the membrane of the central capsule,
and disposed with the apex turned towards the centre (see note B). More
rarely than in the cortical layer, a similar radial structure is to be
found in the innermost medullary layer immediately surrounding the nucleus.
Here the endoplasm sometimes breaks up into fine radial threads, which are
anatomically separable and hang down from the free nucleus as thin
processes (see note C). In some cases it is also possible to isolate radial
rods from the cortical layer of teased out central capsules.

  {xlvii}A. The radial structure of the endoplasm was first described in my
  Monograph (1862, p. 74), though R. Hertwig (1879, p. 112) was the first
  to indicate its typical significance in the case of the PERIPYLEA, and to
  demonstrate its causal relation with the radial currents in the central
  capsule of this legion. More recent investigations have led me to the
  conviction that this phenomenon is more widespread, and often more
  strongly developed, than was formerly imagined, and that it is probably
  one of the typical characters of all SPUMELLARIA (at least of the
  Monozoa).

  B. The centripetal cones of _Physematium_, which have hitherto been known
  only in these colossal Thalassosphærida, were fully described in my
  Monograph under the name "conical centripetal cell-groups"; by their
  first discoverer, A. Schneider (L. N. 13), they were termed "nests," and
  compared with the "nests" (central capsules) of the Polycyttaria. In the
  _Physematium mülleri_ of the Mediterranean (hitherto only observed by
  Schneider and myself at Messina) it appeared as though each centripetal
  cone were composed of a group of from three to nine (usually four or
  five) slender wedge-shaped cells, whose common centripetal apex was
  produced into a radial thread of sarcode (L. N. 16, p. 258, Taf. iii.
  fig. 7). Since then (1866) I have observed at Lanzerote, in the Canary
  Islands, a nearly related form, which I take to be _Physematium
  atlanticum_, Meyen.  In this, however, the "centripetal cell-groups" were
  wanting, and the whole cortical layer of the endoplasm was cleft into
  numerous radial portions, each enclosing a nucleus (probably the
  mother-cells of flagellate spores, see p. 35).

  C. The radial fibres of the medullary endoplasm which cling to an
  extracted nucleus have been observed by Hertwig in certain #Sphæroidea#
  (_Diplosphæra_, _Arachnosphæra_) (L. N. 33, p. 40).


78. _The Endoplasm of the Actipylea._--The intracapsular protoplasm of the
ACANTHARIA or ACTIPYLEA is often distinguished by a partial or complete
radial arrangement like that of the PERIPYLEA, but differing in the number,
size, form, and distribution of the radial portions into which the
endoplasm is differentiated. For since the pores of the capsule membrane
are distributed at equal distances all over the surface in the SPUMELLARIA,
whilst in the ACANTHARIA they are arranged in definite groups, and since
the number and arrangement of the pores has a direct influence upon the
internal currents of the endoplasm, it follows that the radial structure in
the latter legion must be very different from that in the former. In
addition to this there must not be forgotten the important influence which
the early centrogenous formation of the skeletal rods exercises upon the
disposition and growth of the intracapsular structures. Hence the endoplasm
of the ACANTHARIA does not separate into innumerable thin, closely packed
radial wedges or cortical radial rods, but into a small number of large
pyramidal portions between which run the radially disposed heterogeneous
portions of the contents of the capsule, viz., the radial bars of acanthin
and the peculiar intracapsular "axial threads." As a direct consequence of
the regular disposition of these heterogeneous radial portions, which is
often characteristic of the various families of the ACANTHARIA, a
corresponding differentiation of the endoplasm is brought about; it divides
into a number of conical or pyramidal portions (radial pyramids), whose
bases rest upon the capsule-membrane and whose apices are directed towards
the centre of {xlviii}the capsule (the central star of the skeleton).
These radial pyramids are, however, but rarely visible, being usually more
or less concealed by a dark pigment.

  The differentiations of the endoplasm in the central capsule of the
  ACTIPYLEA have been but little investigated, but they appear to vary
  somewhat in the different groups of this legion. In all ACANTHARIA in
  which the twenty radial bars are regularly arranged according to the
  Müllerian law (see p. 717) and in which axial threads constant in number
  and disposition run between them from the central star to the
  capsule-membrane, it obviously follows that the endoplasm must be divided
  into more or less distinct radial pyramids, and this must the case
  whether these take the form of continuous tracts or of actually separable
  portions. The regular polygonal figures, often seen on the surface of the
  central capsule (with special distinctness in _Acanthometron elasticum_
  and _Acanthometron pellucidum_) separated by a network of granular
  threads, are the bases of such radial pyramids (see Hertwig, L. N. 43, p.
  12, Taf. i. figs. 1-7).


79. _The Endoplasm  of the Monopylea._--The intracapsular protoplasm of the
NASSELLARIA or MONOPYLEA is distinguished from that of any of the other
three legions by the development of a quite peculiar fibrillar structure,
the axial "pseudopodial cone," which may shortly be termed the "podoconus"
(foot-cone). Since this is in direct correlation with the peculiar
structure of the capsular opening, the large "porochora," which is situated
at the basal pole of the main axis, it is quite as characteristic of the
legion as the latter itself (see note A). The podoconus is primitively a
vertical regular cone whose circular base occupies the horizontal porochora
or "basal porous area" of the central capsule, while its vertical axis
coincides with that of the latter. The apex of the cone, usually somewhat
rounded off, is therefore directed towards the aboral or apical pole of the
central capsule and separated from it by a larger or smaller interval. In
this interval the nucleus originally lies (as in Pl. 51, fig. 13; Pl. 98,
fig. 13); but it is usually displaced subsequently and lies excentrically.
The cone is of very variable height; on an average its vertical height is
about equal to the diameter of its horizontal base; these dimensions are,
however, dependent upon the form of the central capsule; the height being
greater in slender ovoid or conical capsules, and less in depressed
sphæroidal or discoidal ones, than the diameter of the base. The podoconus
consists of differentiated endoplasm, which becomes more deeply stained by
carmine and offers greater resistance to solvents than the surrounding
finely granular protoplasm. The apex, especially, becomes very intensely
stained. It always exhibits a very characteristic fine but distinct
striation, numerous straight radial lines diverging from the apex of the
cone towards the base. The number of these striæ appears to correspond with
that of the vertical rods in the porochora, and each of these latter stands
apparently in direct communication with the basal end of an apical stria (§
59). These threads are probably differentiated constant contractile threads
of endoplasm, or even myophanes, comparable with the contractile cortical
threads of the CANNOPYLEA and the permanent axial threads of the ACTIPYLEA.
 The numerous modifications, {xlix}undergone by the form and contents of
the central capsule in the different groups of MONOPYLEA, especially those
due to the formation of the skeleton, are not without influence upon the
podoconus. The most important divergencies from the above described primary
form are the following:--(1) The vertical axial cone becomes oblique, its
axis inclining in the sagittal plane and approaching either the dorsal or
the ventral wall of the capsule; the cause of this appears to be usually
the excentric development of the growing nucleus or the formation of a
large oil-globule. (2) The smooth mantle of the podoconus becomes divided
by three longitudinal furrows into three equal prominent ridges, which
correspond to three circular lobes in the porochora; the cause of this
basal triradial lobular formation lies probably in the triradial
development of the skeleton in many NASSELLARIA or in the cortinar
structure of the collar septum. (3) The simple podoconus splits into three
or four elongated lobes, which eventually become almost completely
separated and correspond to the lobes of the central capsule, in the axial
wall of which they lie as longitudinally striated bands. The behaviour of
these bands justifies the hypothesis that the podoconus is a muscular
differentiated portion of the endoplasm and is composed of myophane
fibrillæ, whose contraction determines the opening of the central capsule.

  A. The podoconus of the MONOPYLEA was first described by R. Hertwig in
  1879, and recognised as a characteristic component of the central capsule
  in the most various groups of this legion (in #Plectoidea#, #Stephoidea#,
  #Spyroidea#, and #Cyrtoidea#; see his figures, _loc. cit._, Taf. vii.,
  viii., and the description, pp. 71, 73, 83, 106). Hertwig called it the
  "pseudopodial cone," and regarded it as a conical process of the
  capsule-membrane, which is developed from this latter and projects from
  the porous area into the interior of the central capsule; "it is
  penetrated by fine canals which arise at the apex of the cone, diverge
  towards the base, and terminate there in the rods of the pseudopodial
  area. The intracapsular protoplasm penetrates at the apex of the
  pseudopodial cone into its fine canals, runs along them and emerges from
  the rods of the porous area in the form of slender threads" (_loc. cit._,
  p. 19). I cannot agree with this view of Hertwig, although I have been
  able to confirm the accuracy of his description by my own observations
  upon numerous excellently stained and preserved preparations in the
  Challenger collection. As I have proved by numerous teased out
  preparations, and as Hertwig himself correctly states, "the cone is more
  readily detached from the membrane than from the protoplasm, when the
  capsule is teased" (_loc. cit._, p. 73). Hence I regard the podoconus not
  as a differentiated portion of the capsule-membrane but as endoplasm, and
  believe that it is composed of myophanes or "contractile muscular
  fibrils" in the same manner as the cortical layer of the CANNOPYLEA.
  Probably the contraction of these fibrils serves to raise the opercular
  rods and hence to allow the exit of the endoplasm through the pores which
  lie between these opercular rhabdillae (compare § 59).


80. _The Endoplasm of the Cannopylea._--The intracapsular protoplasm of the
PHÆODARIA or CANNOPYLEA is distinguished from that of the other three
legions by several characteristic peculiarities, which are very important,
since they stand in causal relation to the typical structure of the
capsule-membrane and in particular of its {l}remarkable aperture. In the
case of many and perhaps of all PHÆODARIA the endoplasm is differentiated
into a granular medullary and a thin fibrillar cortical layer, the former
of which usually encloses numerous small vacuoles, while the latter
contains muscular fibrillæ. In the voluminous central capsule of large
PHÆODARIA the whole cortical layer of the endoplasm, which lies immediately
below the delicate inner capsule-membrane, sometimes appears delicately and
regularly striated, and most distinctly so under the apertures, towards the
centre of each of which the dark striæ are radially directed (see note A,
below). These striæ are probably contractile muscular fibrillæ; or
"myophanes," by whose contraction the openings are voluntarily widened. In
the Tripylea this fibrillar star is much more strongly developed under the
astropyle (the main opening) than under the parapylæ (or accessory
openings); and probably the peculiar radial structure of the operculum of
the former is due to the stronger development of these radial fibrils
(being their impression). In many PHÆODARIA, indeed, the fine myophane
fibrils are only visible under the apertures, whilst in others they form a
continuous fibrillar cortical layer on the whole inner surface of the inner
capsule-membrane; the fine fibrillæ run meridionally from one pole of the
main axis to the other; perhaps the whole central capsule may change its
form in consequence of their contractions. The medullary portion of the
endoplasm, which lies below this thin cortical layer, is usually finely
granular in the PHÆODARIA, and permeated by numerous spherical vacuoles,
which are noteworthy from their equal size and regular distribution. Each
clear vacuole usually contains a dark shining fat-granule, more rarely a
group of such granules (see note B). Compare § 60, and Pl. 101, figs. 1-3;
Pl. 104, figs. 1, 2; Pl. 111, fig. 2; Pl. 128, fig. 2, &c.

  A. The fine fibrillæ in the cortical layer of the endoplasm were first
  described by Hertwig in 1879 (L. N. 33, p. 98, Taf x. figs. 6-10). He
  found them, however, only below the three openings in the capsule of the
  Tripylea, where they form three stellate groups of fibrils. I find them
  very clearly shown, and with especial distinctness, under the astropyle
  in most PHÆODARIA of which I have had the opportunity of examining
  well-stained and preserved central capsules. In many cases, also, the
  striation is not confined to the apertures, but spreads over the whole
  cortical layer. Perhaps this constitutes in all PHÆODARIA a thin
  myophane-sheet, whose contractile fibrils run from one pole of the main
  axis to the other and cause by their contraction changes in the form of
  the spheroidal central capsule.

  B. The granular medullary portion of the endoplasm of the PHÆODARIA, with
  its numerous clear spherical vacuoles, was first described in my
  Monograph (1862), in the case of _Aulacantha_ (p. 263), _Aulosphæra_ (p.
  359), and _Coelodendrum_ (p. 361) as a "finely granular, mucous substance
  (intracapsular sarcode), packed more or less closely with clear spherical
  vesicles from 0.005 to 0.015 mm. in diameter, each of which contains one
  or two, rarely three, dark shining granules." That these clear spheres
  are true vacuoles was first clearly proved by Hertwig (L. N. 33, p. 98).
  As a rule all the vacuoles of the same central capsule are of equal size
  (generally from 0.008 to 0.012 mm. in diameter), and are distributed at
  equal intervals throughout the finely granular endoplasm.



{li}CHAPTER III.--THE EXTRACAPSULUM.

(§§ 81-100).

81. _The Components of the Extracapsulum._--The extracapsulum or
extracapsular malacoma, under which name are included all those parts of
the soft body which lie outside the central capsule, consists of the
following constant, and important constituents:--(1) The _calymma_ or
extracapsular jelly-veil; (2) the _sarcomatrix_ or layer of exoplasm
immediately surrounding the membrane of the central capsule; (3) the
_sarcodictyum_ or network of exoplasm, covering the surface of the calymma;
(4) the _pseudopodia_ or radial fibres of exoplasm, which may again be
subdivided into intracalymmar pseudopodia, uniting the sarcomatrix and
sarcodictyum, and extracalymmar pseudopodia, radiating freely into the
water outside the calymma.


82. _The Calymma._--The calymma or extracapsular jelly-veil of the
Radiolaria is always the most voluminous portion of the extracapsulum, and
in spite of its simple structureless constitution is of great morphological
and physiological importance. In all Radiolaria this gelatinous mantle
completely surrounds the central capsule, but is separated from its outer
surface by a continuous, though thin, layer of exoplasm, the sarcomatrix.
The pseudopodia radiating from the latter pierce the calymma, form the
sarcodictyum at its surface, and radiate from its nodal points freely into
the surrounding water. The calymma is rarely visible in living freshly
captured Radiolaria, examined in sea-water, for its gelatinous substance is
perfectly hyaline, colourless and pellucid, and possesses the same
refractive index as sea-water; but when the object is removed from this
fluid and transferred to carmine solution or some other colouring matter,
the extent and figure of the calymma become apparent, for the staining
fluid does not at first penetrate into the gelatinous material. When this
has taken place, however (after a longer or shorter time), and the
gelatinous material has become coloured, its form and size may be observed
by the converse experiment; the object is transferred once more to water
and the outlines of the calymma become as clear as those of the central
capsule. The same is the case with dead specimens in which the sticky
surface of the calymma has become covered with dust.

  The jelly-veil of the Radiolaria was recognised even by the earliest
  observers of the group, Meyen (1834), and Huxley (1851), and compared
  with that of the Palmellaria; the former noticed it in _Physematium_ and
  _Sphærozoum_ (L. N. 1, p. 283), and the latter in _Thalassicolla_ and
  _Collosphæra_ (L. N. 5, p. 433). In all these SPUMELLARIA, both in the
  monozootic _Thalassicolla_ and in the polyzootic _Sphærozoum_ and
  _Collosphæra_, the calymma is very voluminous and filled with large
  alveoli. Meyen called them "muco-gelatinous masses, in the interior of
  which are contained small equal-sized vesicles"; Huxley likewise found
  clear vesicles in the jelly and compared them with Dujardin's vacuoles.
  Johannes Müller observed the jelly-veil in many different Radiolaria, in
  particular in the #Acanthometra#, first discovered by him, but
  erroneously believed that it only originated {lii}after death by
  liquefaction of the sarcode (L. N. 12, p. 6). This mistake is, however,
  easy to understand, since in living Radiolaria the calymma is usually
  invisible on account of its perfect transparency, whilst in dead
  specimens it is usually quite distinct on account of the dust clinging to
  its adhesive surface. I myself believed that the formation of the
  voluminous hyaline jelly-veil was only partially due to liquefaction
  after death, but that it was to some extent present in the living
  organism and that it might vanish and subsequently reappear by means of
  imbibition (L. N. 16, pp. 109, 110). R. Hertwig was the first to
  demonstrate, in 1879, that the jelly-veil is constantly present in living
  Radiolaria, that it forms the basis of the extracapsular malacoma and
  surrounds the central capsule as a second protective sheath (L. N. 33, p.
  114).


83. _The Structure of the Calymma._--The extracapsular jelly-veil appears
structureless in most Radiolaria, inasmuch as it represents a homogeneous
pellucid excretion of the exoplasm and contains neither fibres nor other
formed structures. In some groups, however, definite structural characters
become secondarily developed. The most common and striking of these is the
formation of alveoles, which takes place in the extracapsulum (see § 86).
In consequence of this the calymma assumes a remarkable frothy consistency
and appears to be composed of large, clear, thin-walled vesicles; this is
especially the case in the #Collodaria# (#Colloidea#, Pls. 1, 3, and
#Beloidea#, Pls. 2, 4), and in many large PHÆODARIA, especially among the
#Phæocystina# (Phæodinida and Cannorrhaphida, Pl. 101, and Aulacanthida,
Pls. 102-104). More rarely the calymma is not permeated by vacuoles, but
there appear in it fine striæ parallel to the surface as though it were
composed of thin concentric laminæ like an onion; perhaps these are the
expressions of a different quantity of water in the various layers. In the
calymma of many Radiolaria thin, straight, radial lines are to be seen,
which are probably pseudopodia, and not to be attributed to any structural
modification, or they may be slender canals which serve for the exit of the
pseudopodia. On the outer surface of the calymma of different Radiolaria,
and especially in the ACANTHARIA, a peculiar network of fibres is to be
found, composed of polygonal meshes, like elastic fibres, probably due to a
local thickening of the jelly. These polygonal meshes are often very
regularly distributed between the radial spines of the #Acanthometra#, and
stand in a definite relation to them. The fibres which form the meshes are
often rather strong, resembling elastic fibres, as above-mentioned, and
either simple or composed of bundles of very fine fibrillæ (L. N. 33, p.
15, Taf. i. fig. 1, Taf. ii. fig. 4).


84. _The Consistency of the Calymma._--The gelatinous material of which the
calymma of the Radiolaria consists is a pellucid mass, rich in water and
usually quite hyaline and structureless; its consistency is very variable.
In the majority of the Radiolaria it may perhaps be about equal to that of
the jelly which composes the umbrella of most Medusæ; but as in these
latter it may vary between very wide extremes, constituting on the one hand
a very soft jelly-mantle, offering but little {liii}resistance to
mechanical influences and almost disintegrating under the eyes of the
observer, and on the other hand forming a firm gelatinous shell, comparable
to cartilage in hardness, elasticity, and power of mechanical resistance.
In many Radiolaria of large dimensions with an alveolar calymma (especially
in numerous #Collodaria# and PHÆODARIA) this may be split by means of
dissecting needles and the central capsule extracted like the stone from a
cherry, and then it is easy to ascertain that the firmness and elasticity
of this jelly-veil are not less than those of a cherry. The different
degrees of consistency in the various Radiolaria may be dependent either
upon the relative amount of water which they contain, or upon qualitative
or quantitative variations in the organic substance of which the jelly
consists. Great importance is to be attached to the considerable
consistency of the calymma, because it furnishes the indispensable
groundwork for the deposition of many parts of the skeleton and
particularly of the lattice-shells.


85. _The Primary and Secondary Calymma._--In most Radiolaria the external
form and volume of the calymma are different at different stages of growth,
and this difference is mainly dependent upon the development of the
skeleton. Hence it is advisable to distinguish in general the primary from
the secondary calymma. The _primary calymma_ is in the great majority of
Radiolaria a perfect sphere, in the middle of which lies the concentric
central capsule; on the surface of this gelatinous plate the primary
spherical lattice-shell is secreted in most SPUMELLARIA and
#Acanthophracta#, as well as in those PHÆODARIA which possess a spherical
shell; in the remaining PHÆODARIA also and in the NASSELLARIA, where the
lattice-shell is not spherical but monaxon, it is secreted on the surface
of the primary calymma. This takes place at a definite time, very important
in the development of the Radiolarian, which for the sake of brevity we
shall term the "_lorication-period_." Since the firm surface of the primary
calymma furnishes the necessary foundation for the deposition of the
primary lattice-shell, it is of the greatest mechanical significance in all
shell-bearing Radiolaria. The _secondary calymma_ arises only after the
lorication-period by further growth of the primitive jelly-mantle and in
the fully developed Radiolarian usually encloses wholly or partially the
external parts of the skeleton, in consequence of which it assumes the most
various forms. Very often the secondary calymma is polyhedral, being
stretched between the radial spines of the skeleton, the distal ends of the
latter then forming the fixed points of the gelatinous polyhedron.


86. _The Extracapsular Vacuoles and Alveoles._--The calymma of the
Radiolaria usually appears completely homogeneous and hyaline without any
structure; sometimes it encloses numerous clear vesicles, vacuoles or
alveoles, and then assumes a frothy appearance, the expression of a more or
less distinct alveolar structure. {liv}The clear vesicles to which this is
due are either spherical, or polyhedral from mutual pressure, and like the
similar ones in the central capsule may be divided into membraneless
vacuoles and vesicular alveoles. The _vacuoles_ are simple drops of fluid,
without a special envelope, and immediately surrounded by the gelatinous
substance of the calymma, in which they appear as simple cavities. The
_alveoles_ on the contrary are true vesicles, with a thin envelope, which
encloses a drop of fluid or a globule of jelly; in the latter case its
contents are different in refracting power and amount of contained water
from the substance of the surrounding calymma. A sharp boundary between the
membraneless vacuoles and the vesicular alveoles cannot be drawn in the
case of the extracapsular hyaline spheres any more than in the
intracapsular; the envelope of the alveoles is sometimes very distinct and
even anatomically separable, whilst at other times it is very thin and
scarcely recognisable; it may occasionally arise and disappear within a
very short time (see note A). There is no doubt that in the calymma as in
the central capsule the vesicular alveoles are secondary products, which
have arisen from the vacuoles by the secretion of an enveloping membrane.
This membrane is either a delicate sheath of exoplasm, or a firmer and more
resistant skin, distinct from the exoplasm, and probably an excretion from
it (_e.g._, Pl. 4, figs. 2, 3). In many cases the outer surface even of the
vacuoles is covered by a network of pseudopodia, which form a sarcoplegma
similar to a fenestrated alveolar membrane. The colourless pellucid fluid
in the vacuoles and alveoles is usually simple sea-water, more rarely it
contains a small quantity of albumen ("albumen-spheres") or jelly
("gelatinous spheres"). The size of these spheres is very variable. Quite
small vacuoles may be found in the calymma of many Radiolaria. Large
vacuoles, on the other hand, producing the appearance of an alveolar
structure, are confined to but few groups, to a part of the SPUMELLARIA
(#Colloidea#, #Beloidea#, and a few #Sphæroidea#), and to the #Phæocystina#
(PHÆODARIA with incomplete skeleton); besides they occur only rarely in
individual genera, _e.g._, _Nassella_ among the skeletonless NASSELLARIA.
Since the volume of the calymma is much increased by the development of
vacuoles, and the power of mechanical resistance is at the same time much
increased, the fact is explained that the vacuoles occur mainly in
Radiolaria which have no skeleton or only an incomplete one (see note B).
Among the monozootic #Collodaria# the alveolar structure is especially well
developed in the following genera; _Thalassicolla_ (Pl. 1, figs. 4, 5),
_Thalassophysa_, _Thalassoplancta_, _Lampoxanthium_ (Pl. 2, figs. 1, 2);
among the PHÆODARIA in most genera of the Phæodinida, Cannorrhaphida and
Aulacanthida (Pls. 101-104), and probably also in other voluminous
PHÆODARIA (_e.g._, #Phæosphæria#). The alveoles or vacuoles in the calymma
of these large Radiolaria lie usually in several layers, one above another,
and increase in size from within outwards. The Polycyttaria or social
Radiolaria (the three families Collozoida, Sphærozoida and Collosphærida)
without exception have an alveolar structure, and the special form of
{lv}their colonies or coenobia is to a great extent determined by the
development, number, size and arrangement of the alveoles in their calymma
(compare Pls. 3-8). In these cases there is not unfrequently developed a
large central alveole (see note C) whose thickened wall encloses a globe of
jelly and serves as the central support of the whole colony (Pl. 5, fig.
1). Still more striking, however, is the arrangement of certain
Polycyttaria, where each individual of the colony (or each central capsule
with its calymma) is enclosed in a large alveole, whose firm wall often
attains considerable thickness (Pl. 4, figs. 2, 3). The whole colony then
appears as an aggregate of numerous cells, each of which possesses two
envelopes, the inner central capsule and the outer alveolar membrane;
between these lies in the Collosphærida the siliceous lattice-shell (Pl. 6,
fig. 2). These pericapsular alveoles may be regarded as an outer cell-wall
more correctly than the membrane of the central capsule itself, but the
arrangement may also be compared to the temporary encystation of other
Protista (see note D).

  A. The extracapsular vacuoles in the calymma were first observed in 1851
  by Huxley, in _Thalassicolla_ and _Sphærozoum_, and compared with
  Dujardin's sarcode vacuoles (L. N. 5). Afterwards J. Müller noticed that
  generally these "large clear vesicles are covered by a fine membrane,"
  and hence he called them "alveoles" (L. N. 12, pp. 3, 7, &c.). In my
  Monograph I have described them more in detail as "extracapsular
  alveoles" (1862, p. 88, Tafs. i.-iii. xxxii.-xxxv.). Ever since then the
  point has been debated whether these clear spaces are simple vacuoles in
  the sense of Huxley or vesicular alveoles as stated by J. Müller. This
  contention is unnecessary, for both varieties are present, and often no
  sharp line can be drawn between them. R. Hertwig has recently come to the
  conclusion that they are as a rule "membraneless vacuoles," but that they
  "sometimes become surrounded by a special envelope" (L. N. 33, p. 31). He
  even succeeded "in extracting from a _Collosphæra_ the large vesicle
  which lies in the centre of many colonies and removing its covering of
  central capsules and jelly."

  B. The _mechanical importance_ of the alveolar structure, which certainly
  increases the elasticity and mechanical resistance of the voluminous
  calymma, has not yet been sufficiently realised; in the case of those
  Radiolaria which have no skeleton, or at all events no lattice-shell, it
  may take the place of this as a protective envelope. Furthermore, by
  taking in and giving out water it may discharge a hydrostatic function,
  causing the organism to rise or sink in the water.

  C. The _large central alveole_ found in the colonies of many Polycyttaria
  (especially Collosphærida) and first described in my Monograph (Taf.
  xxxiv. fig. 1), has since then been observed by Hertwig, Bütschli, and
  other investigators, and recognised as the "central support of the whole
  colony, surrounded by a delicate membrane" (compare L. N. 33, p. 31, and
  L. N. 41, p. 436). In a colony of _Trypanosphæra transformata_ (Pl. 5,
  fig. 1), which I observed living while in Ceylon in 1881, the membrane of
  the large central alveole was surrounded by a firm network of
  sarcoplegma, and could be mechanically isolated from the central
  jelly-sphere which it enclosed.

  D. The _pericapsular alveoles_, figured in Pl. 4, figs. 2, 3, from a
  _Sphærozoum_, and in Pl. 6, fig. 2, from a _Siphonosphæra_, were very
  well preserved in some preparations in the Challenger collection; perhaps
  their development coincides with the formation of spores, and may be
  regarded as an encystation.


{lvi}87. _The Extracapsular Fat-Globules._--Fat is probably as widely
distributed in the exoplasm as in the endoplasm of the Radiolaria; a
considerable proportion of the small, dark, highly refractive granules
appear to consist of fat; most likely they are for the most part direct
products of metastasis. These widely-spread granules, which are sometimes
coloured, and which by their passive motion produce the phenomenon of
granular circulation in the exoplasm, are not the only fatty structures in
the extracapsulum; larger globules sometimes occur. In certain large
#Collodaria# (_e.g._, _Thalassicolla melacapsa_, Pl. 1, fig. 5;
_Thalassophysa sanguinolenta_, &c.) radial series of oil-globules are found
in the calymma, especially in its proximal portion; in others the central
capsule is surrounded by a layer of oil-globules (situated in the
sarcomatrix). In the PHÆODARIA a part of the phæodium appears to consist of
fat-globules.


88. _The Extracapsular Pigment._--The formation of colouring matters in the
extracapsulum is on the whole rare in the Radiolaria, apart from the
"yellow cells" (see § 91) and from the peculiar phæodium of the PHÆODARIA,
which will be separately treated of in the next paragraph. Considerable
masses of extracapsular pigment, usually black or blue, rarely brown or
red, are found only in a few Radiolaria belonging to the first three
legions; most often in the SPUMELLARIA. Some large #Collodaria#, _e.g._,
the common _Thalassicolla nucleata_ and a few other species of this genus
(Pl. 1, fig. 4), are characterised by a rich deposit of black or blue
pigment in the sarcomatrix and in the proximal portion of the calymma.
Brown pigment is deposited in the calymma of many #Sphæroidea# and
#Discoidea#, as well as of some NASSELLARIA (_Cystidium_, _Tridictyopus_,
&c.). In a part of the ACANTHARIA red pigment granules are thickly strewn
in the sarcoplegma and pass along the free pseudopodia, as for example in
_Actinelius purpureus_ and _Acanthostaurus purpurascens_. The composition
and significance of these extracapsular pigments are not completely known.

  On the extracapsular pigment of _Thalassicolla nucleata_, compare my
  Monograph, pp. 87, 251. On the red extracapsular pigment-granules of the
  ACANTHARIA, see L. N. 19, pp. 345, 364, &c.


89. _The Phæodium of the Phæodaria._--The PHÆODARIA, which are
distinguished from the other three legions of Radiolaria by the double
membrane of the central capsule, and the peculiar structure of the
main-opening (astropyle), differ also in other points, the most important
of which is the constant presence of a voluminous mass of extracapsular
pigment. This possesses a peculiar constitution and special significance,
and is not to be confounded with the extracapsular pigment-granules of
other Radiolaria (_e.g._, _Thalassicolla_), and hence it has been
distinguished by the name "Phæodium," and the individual granules which
compose it as "Phæodella" (see note A). The phæodium is always excentric in
position relatively to the central capsule, of which it {lvii}surrounds the
oral half in the form of a voluminous concavo-convex cap, hiding the
astropyle at its basal pole so completely that the latter is rarely visible
until the phæodium has been removed (Pls. 99-104; Pl. 115, fig. 8; Pl. 123,
&c.). The central capsule is generally almost completely embedded in the
phæodium, so that only its aboral pole (with the two parapylæ in the
TRIPYLEA) projects. In the #Phæogromia#, in which the lattice-shell
possesses a special opening and the central capsule lies excentrically in
the aboral position of its interior, the phæodium occupies the oral aspect,
between the capsule and the aperture (Pls. 99, 100, 118-120, &c.). In the
peculiar family Coelographida (Pls. 126-128) a special receptacle (galea
with its rhinocanna) for the phæodium is developed outside the bivalve
shell, within which the central capsule lies. The proboscis, which in all
PHÆODARIA arises from the centre of the astropyle, lies in the vertical
axis of the phæodium and is entirely surrounded by it. The volume of the
phæodium in the majority of the PHÆODARIA may be said to be about as great
as that of the central capsule, although in some species it is considerably
larger. Its colour is always dark, usually between green and brown,
commonly olive-green or blackish-brown, rarely reddish-brown or black. The
phæodellæ or pigment-granules which make up the greater part of the
phæodium (see note B) are irregular in form and unequal in size and show no
definite structure; usually they are spherical or ellipsoidal, and exhibit
fine parallel striæ which run transversely or obliquely (Pl. 101, fig. 3,
6, 10; Pl. 103, fig. 1, &c.). Between the larger granules is usually found
a thick dust-like mass of innumerable very small grains. The physiological
significance of this peculiar phæodium is still unknown, but is probably
considerable, judging from its large size and especially from its constant
topographical relation to the astropyle; the latter consideration would
lead to the supposition that it plays an important part in the nutrition
and metastasis of the PHÆODARIA (see note C).

  A. The phæodium of _Aulacantha_, _Thalassoplancta_, and _Coelodendrum_
  was first described in 1862, in my Monograph, as an excentric
  extracapsular mass of pigment of blackish-brown or olive-green colour
  (pp. 87, 262, 264, 361, Taf. ii. iii. xxxii.). Since then John Murray,
  who investigated many living PHÆODARIA during the Challenger expedition,
  has shown its general distribution in this legion (Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond.,
  vol. xxiv. p. 536, 1876). From the constancy of its presence I gave the
  legion the name PHÆODARIA in 1879 (L. N. 34).

  B. With regard to the special composition of the phæodium and the
  constitution of the phæodellæ, see the general description of the
  PHÆODARIA, pp. 1533-1537.

  C. Perhaps the phæodellæ are to some extent symbiontes with the
  PHÆODARIA; the xanthellæ present in most other Radiolaria are absent in
  this legion.


90. _The Extracapsular Xanthellæ._--Xanthellæ or Zooxanthellæ, symbiotic
"yellow cells," are very commonly found in the extracapsulum of the
Radiolaria, especially in many SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA; whilst in the
ACANTHARIA similar yellow cells usually only occur within the central
capsule, and in the PHÆODARIA their {lviii}presence has not been certainly
demonstrated. The extracapsular Xanthellæ are found most abundantly in the
#Collodaria#, both in the monozootic Thalassicollida and in the polyzootic
Sphærozoida. They occur in smaller numbers in the #Sphærellaria#, and in
many divisions of the latter they seem to be entirely absent. Also it
sometimes happens that, though present in large numbers in some
SPUMELLARIA, they are entirely absent in others nearly related to them;
indeed, this has also been observed in the case of different individuals of
the same species. This fact alone is sufficient to show that the Xanthellæ
are not an integral part of the Radiolarian organism (as was formerly
believed) but parasites or more correctly symbiontes, which live as
inhabitants of the calymma. More recent investigations have shown, that
besides the yellow pigment-grains they contain starch or an amyloid
substance, that is to say, vegetable reserve materials, that their thin
envelope contains cellulose, and that their yellow colouring-matter
resembles chlorophyll and is related to that of the Diatomaceæ
("Diatomin"). Hence they are now generally regarded as unicellular Algæ,
nearly related to those which occur as symbiontes in other marine animals
(_Exuviella_, &c.). The starch, which they develop with the formation of
oxygen, may serve as nutriment to the Radiolaria, while the carbonic acid
yielded by the latter is also beneficial to the Xanthellæ. The form of the
Xanthellæ is usually spherical and elliptical, often also sphæroidal or
discoidal. Their diameter is usually between 0.008 and 0.012 mm., rarely
more or less. The differences exhibited by Xanthellæ which live in
different groups of Radiolaria demand further investigation, which will
perhaps lead to the establishment of several species of the genus
_Zooxanthella_. At present _Zooxanthella extracapsularis_, in the calymma
of SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, may be clearly distinguished from
_Zooxanthella intracapsularis_, in the central capsule of the ACANTHARIA.

  The "yellow cells" were first described in 1851 by Huxley, in the
  #Collodaria#, and afterwards by J. Müller (1858) in many SPUMELLARIA and
  NASSELLARIA. In my Monograph (1862, pp. 84-87) I gave a detailed account
  of their structure and increase by division, and laid special emphasis on
  the fact that they are the only elements in the Radiolarian organism
  which "are _undoubtedly cells_ in the strict histological sense of the
  word." Afterwards, in my Beiträge zur Plastiden-Theorie, I showed the
  constant presence of "starch in the yellow cells of the Radiolaria"
  (1870, L. N. 21). Shortly afterwards Cienkowski observed that the yellow
  cells live independently and reproduce themselves after the death of the
  Radiolaria, and in consequence first put forth the hypothesis that they
  do not belong to the Radiolarian organism, but that they are unicellular
  Algæ parasitic upon it (1871, L. N. 22). This view was ten years later
  more fully established by Karl Brandt, and elucidated by comparison with
  the symbiosis of the gonidia of Algæ, and the hyphæ of Fungi in the
  formation of Lichens, which had in the meantime become known (1881, L. N.
  38). Brandt gave this unicellular yellow Alga the name _Zooxanthella
  nutricola_, and afterwards gave fuller details regarding its remarkable
  vital relations (L. N. 39). Patrick Geddes, who named it _Philozoon_,
  supplemented this account and showed experimentally that it gives off
  oxygen under the influence of sun-light (1882, L. N. 42, 43).  In
  consequence {lix}of this there is no doubt that all Xanthellæ (the
  _Zooxanthella extracapsularis_ of SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, and the
  _Zooxanthella intracapsularis_ of the ACANTHARIA, and possibly also the
  _Zooxanthella phæodaris_ of the PHÆODARIA) do not originally belong to
  the Radiolarian organism, as was believed up to the time of Cienkowski,
  but penetrate actively into it from without, or are taken in passively by
  means of the pseudopodia. In any case their symbiosis, when they are
  associated with the Radiolarian cell in large numbers, may be of great
  advantage to both parties, since the metastasis of the Xanthella is
  vegetable, that of the Radiolarian animal in character. In any case their
  symbiosis is to a large extent accidental, by no means as necessary as in
  the case of the Lichens. See on these points in addition to Brandt and
  Geddes (_loc. cit._) also Geza Enz, Das Consortial-Verhältniss von Algen
  und Thieren, Biol. Centralbl., Bd. ii. No. 15, 1883, Oskar Hertwig, Die
  Symbiose oder das Genossenschaftsleben im Thierreich, Jena, 1883, and
  Bütschli, Die Radiolarien, in Bronn's Klass. u. Ord. d. Thierreichs, 1882
  (L. N. 41, pp. 456-462).


91. _The Exoplasm or Extracapsular Protoplasm._--The extracapsular
protoplasm, which may be shortly termed the "exoplasm" (or ectosarc), is
primitively in all Radiolaria (and especially in their earliest development
stages) the only important constituent of the extracapsulum, besides the
calymma. Although the extracapsular and intracapsular protoplasm of the
Radiolaria are everywhere in direct communication, and although the
openings in the membrane of the central capsule bring about an interchange
between them, still the two portions of sarcode show certain constant and
characteristic differences, which are due to the physiological division of
labour between the central and peripheral parts of the body and their
corresponding morphological differentiation. The extracapsular, like the
intracapsular, protoplasm is originally homogeneous, but may afterwards
become differentiated in various ways, producing the special constituents
of the extracapsulum. Such "external protoplasmic products" are vacuoles,
pigment-bodies, &c. More important, however, are the topographically
different sections into which the exoplasm may be divided according to its
relations to the central capsule and the calymma. In this respect the
following parts may be generally distinguished--(1) the _Sarcomatrix_, or
fundamental layer of the exoplasm, which surrounds the central capsule as a
continuous sheath of sarcode and separates it from the calymma; (2) the
_Sarcoplegma_, an irregular network of the exoplasm, which spreads
throughout the gelatinous material of the calymma; (3) the _Sarcodictyum_
or network of sarcode on the outer surface of the calymma; and (4) the
_Pseudopodia_, which project outwards from the latter and radiate into the
water.


92. _The Sarcomatrix._--The sarcomatrix, being "the fundamental layer of
the pseudopodia" (or "matrix of the exoplasm"), constitutes the proximal
innermost section of the extracapsular sarcode, and in all Radiolaria forms
a thin continuous mucous layer, which covers the whole outer surface of the
central capsule and separates it from the surrounding calymma (see note A,
below). The sarcomatrix communicates internally {lx}through the openings of
the central capsule with the endoplasm, whilst externally the pseudopodia
or mucous threads arise from it, which by their union form the sarcoplegma.
The sarcomatrix is only interrupted in the SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA by
those parts of the skeleton which perforate the membrane of the central
capsule. In all NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA, as in the #Collodaria#, it
appears as a perfectly continuous sarcode-envelope of the central capsule.
Its thickness is variable; in general it is most strongly developed in the
SPUMELLARIA and PHÆODARIA, less so in the NASSELLARIA, and is thinnest in
the ACANTHARIA. The thickness seems, however, to vary even in one and the
same individual, the difference depending partly upon the different stages
of development and partly upon nutritional conditions. After abundant
inception of nutriment the thin protoplasmic layer of the matrix is
thickened and turbid, rich in granules and irregular masses, which are
probably due to enclosed but only half-digested food; xanthellæ also, as
well as foreign bodies taken up with the nutriment, such as frustules of
Diatoms and shells of smaller Radiolaria, and of pelagic infusoria, larvæ,
&c., are often, especially in large individuals, aggregated in considerable
quantities in the matrix. After long fasting, on the contrary, this is poor
in these enclosed bodies and in granules; it then forms a thin colourless
more or less hyaline mucous coating to the central capsule. From a
physiological standpoint the sarcomatrix is to be regarded as the _central
organ of the extracapsulum_, and as of pre-eminent significance. Probably
it is not only the most important organ for the nutrition of the Radiolaria
(especially for digestion and assimilation in particular), but perhaps is
also the central organ of perception. On the other hand the sarcomatrix
belongs to those components of the Radiolarian organism which take no part
in the formation of the skeleton.

  A. The sarcomatrix was first described in my Monograph in 1862 (p. 110)
  as the "Mutterboden der Pseudopodien," possessing a pre-eminent
  physiological importance. Compare also my paper on the sarcode elements
  of the Rhizopoda (Zeitschr. f. wiss. Zool., Bd. xv. p. 342, 1865).


93. _The Sarcoplegma._--By the name sarcoplegma, as distinguished from the
remaining extracapsular sarcode, is understood the intracalymmar web of
exoplasm or "ectosarcode network," which ramifies within the gelatinous
mass of the calymma. Internally it is in direct connection with the
continuous sheath (sarcomatrix), which encloses the central capsule, whilst
externally it is in contact with the superficial sarcode network
(sarcodictyum) which surrounds the calymma. The configuration of this
exoplasmic web, which penetrates the jelly-veil in all directions, is
exceedingly variable; in most Radiolaria it is extremely irregular in form,
like the protoplasmic network in the ground-substance of many kinds of
connective tissue. In some groups, however, it assumes a rather regular
shape which it appears to retain (_e.g._, in many ACANTHARIA). It must be
assumed also that in those instances where the consistency {lxi}of the
calymma approaches that of cartilage, the tracks of the exoplasmic threads
remain constant, but accurate observations are wanting as to how far the
configuration of the sarcoplegma is constant or variable in the different
groups, as well as regarding its peculiar behaviour in those Radiolaria
whose calymma is characterised by the formation of vacuoles or alveoles
(see § 86). Usually it envelops the larger alveoles in the form of a
reticulate veil. In many #Collodaria# the exoplasm is aggregated at certain
points of the intracalymmar web, so that large balls or amoeboid bodies
appear to be distributed between the alveoles, _e.g._, in _Thalassophysa
pelagica_ and _Thalassicolla melacapsa_ (Pl. 1, figs. 4, 5). The
sarcoplegma is metamorphosed directly into silex in the Radiolaria
spongiosa, or those genera which possess a spongy cortical skeleton, and
were formerly known as Spongurida; to this category belong the
Spongosphærida (Pl. 18) and Spongodiscida (Pl. 47) as well as certain
NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA. The single siliceous spicules, which are
irregularly interwoven to form the spongy web, are to be regarded as the
silicified threads of the intracalymmar sarcode network. From a
physiological point of view the sarcoplegma is of importance both for the
nutrition and motion of the Radiolaria, since it brings the sarcomatrix and
the sarcodictyum, with the pseudopodia which radiate from it, into direct
communication.


94. _The Sarcodictyum._--The sarcodictyum may be defined as the
extracalymmar network of exoplasm, and is a reticular covering which lies
upon the outer surface of the gelatinous calymma. Internally, the
sarcodictyum is in direct communication with the sarcoplegma, or the web of
exoplasmic threads which ramifies in the gelatinous substance of the
calymma; externally, on the other hand, the pseudopodia radiate freely from
it; thus its relation to these is similar to that which the sarcomatrix
bears to the roots of the sarcoplegma. Relations similar to those which
have led to the separation of the primary from the secondary calymma,
induce us to distinguish also a primary and secondary sarcodictyum. The
original or _primary sarcodictyum_ ramifies over the surface of the
original or primary calymma, and like this is of pre-eminent importance in
the formation of the primary lattice-shell; if we regard the surface of the
primary calymma as the indispensable foundation for the deposition of this
latter, then the primary sarcodictyum furnishes the material from which it
is developed: silex in the SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, a silicate of
carbon in the PHÆODARIA, and acanthin in the ACANTHARIA. It may indeed be
said that the primary lattice-shell of the Radiolaria arises by a direct
chemical metamorphosis of the primary sarcodictyum, by a chemical
precipitation of the dissolved skeletal material (silex, silicate, or
acanthin), which was stored up in the exoplasm of the sarcodictyum. Hence a
deduction from the special conformation of the former to that of the latter
is permissible. The particular form of the primary lattice-sphere with its
regular or irregular meshes is due to the corresponding form of the primary
sarcodictyum; both regular and irregular forms of this {lxii}commonly
occurring. The form of the _regular sarcodictyum_ with circular or regular
polygonal, usually hexagonal, meshes is constantly maintained during the
formation of the regular lattice-shells (_e.g._, Pl. 12, figs. 5-10; Pl.
52, figs. 8-20; Pl. 96, figs. 2-6; Pl. 113, figs. 1-6). The form of the
_irregular sarcodictyum_, on the other hand, with irregular polygonal or
roundish meshes, persists during the development of the irregular
lattice-shells (_e.g._, Pls. 29, 70, 97, 106). All this is true also of the
_secondary sarcodictyum_, or the exoplasmic network which ramifies over the
surface of the secondary calymma. The secondary lattice-shells, which are
deposited on the surface of the latter, retain the configuration of the
secondary sarcodictyum, by the chemical metamorphosis of which they have
originated; this is the case in many SPUMELLARIA which develop several
concentric lattice-shells (Pl. 29), in some NASSELLARIA (Pl. 54, fig. 5),
in the Phractopeltida among the ACANTHARIA (Pl. 133), and in the
double-shelled PHÆODARIA, Cannosphærida, and part of the Coelodendrida and
Coelographida (Pls. 112, 121, 128). In those Radiolaria which form no
lattice-shell whatever, the conformation of the sarcodictyum is usually
irregular, with meshes of irregular form and unequal size; sometimes,
however, they seem to be very regular, as in many #Acanthometra# (Pl. 129,
fig. 4).


95. _The Pseudopodia._--On the whole the pseudopodia or thread-like
processes of the exoplasm exhibit in the Radiolaria the same characteristic
peculiarities as in all true Rhizopoda; they are usually very numerous,
long and thin, flexible and sensitive filaments of sarcode, which show the
peculiar phenomena of granular movement. Their physiological significance
is in several respects very great, for they serve as active organs for the
inception of nutriment, for locomotion, sensation, and the formation of the
skeleton (see note A, below). The presence of a calymma, however, which
distinguishes the Radiolaria from the other Rhizopoda, brings about certain
modifications in the behaviour of the pseudopodia. If in general all the
threads, which arise from the sarcomatrix or fundamental layer and radiate
outwards, be called "pseudopodia," then that part of them which is included
in the gelatinous substance of the calymma and forms the sarcoplegma may be
termed the "collopodia" (or intracalymmar pseudopodia), and the remaining
portion, which passes outwards from the sarcodictyum freely into the water,
may be described as "astropodia" (or extracalymmar pseudopodia). In many
Radiolaria these two portions present some differences in morphological and
physiological respects, and certain distinctions are probably generally
present (see note B). Apart from this universal differentiation in the
different groups of the Radiolaria, specially modified forms of pseudopodia
may be recognised as the axopodia and myxopodia of the ACANTHARIA (see §
95, A), and the sarcode-flagellum of certain SPUMELLARIA (see note C).

  A. The pseudopodia of the Radiolaria have been so fully described in my
  Monograph, in 1862, both morphologically and physiologically, that I need
  only refer to the account there given {lxiii}(pp. 89-127); for
  supplementary observations see R. Hertwig (1879, L. N. 33, p. 117) and
  Bütschli (1882, L. N. 41, pp. 437-445).

  B. The _Astropodia_, or free radiating pseudopodia, are in many
  Radiolaria more or less clearly distinguishable from the collopodia,
  which form the sarcoplegma within the calymma; how far these distinctions
  depend upon a permanent differentiation (especially in the ACANTHARIA and
  PHÆODARIA) needs further investigation.

  C. The _sarcode-flagellum_ (perhaps better termed _axoflagellum_) was
  first described in my Monograph (1862, p. 115) in the case of various
  #Discoidea# (Taf. xxviii. figs. 5, 8; Taf. xxx. fig. 1). Hertwig has
  given a substantially similar account of the organ in some other
  #Discoidea# (L. N. 33, p. 67, Taf. vi. figs. 10, 11); probably this
  peculiar structure is confined to the order #Discoidea# among the
  SPUMELLARIA, but is widely distributed within its limits. The
  axoflagellum is a thick cylindrical thread of sarcode, finely striated
  and pointed towards its free end. It always lies in the equatorial plane
  of the discoidal body, and always unpaired in one of its axes; in the
  triradiate #Discoidea# it is in the axis of the unpaired principal arm
  and opposite to it (Pl. 43, fig. 15). In the Ommatodiscida (p. 500, Pl.
  48, figs. 8, 19, 20) the axoflagellum probably passes out through the
  peculiar marginal ostium of the shell. Perhaps it is always connected
  with the central nucleus by intracapsular axial fibres, and is to be
  regarded as a specially differentiated bundle of pseudopodia (or
  axopodia?).


95A. _The Myxopodia and Axopodia._--The two forms of pseudopodia which we
distinguish as myxopodia and axopodia differ markedly from each other both
morphologically and physiologically. The _myxopodia_, or ordinary free
pseudopodia, which are found in large numbers in all Radiolaria, and
constitute their most important peripheral organs, are simple homogeneous
exoplasmic threads, which arise from the sarcodictyum or extracalymmar
sarcode network, and radiate freely into the water; here they may branch
and combine by anastomosis to form a changeable network, but they never
contain an axial thread. The _axopodia_, on the other hand, are
differentiated pseudopodia, which consist of a firm radial thread, and a
soft covering of exoplasm; they penetrate the whole calymma in a radial
direction and project freely from its surface, and generally (if not
always) they are produced inwards to the middle of the central capsule,
perforating its membrane; their proximal end is lost in a dark central heap
of granules. Such axopodia are at present known with certainty only in the
ACANTHARIA, where they are widely, and perhaps universally, distributed.
Their development in this legion probably stands in direct causal relation
to the peculiar structure of the central capsule and the centrogenous
formation of the skeleton. Since the radial skeletal rods of the
#Acanthometra# possess originally a thin coating of protoplasm, it may be
said that the centrogenous axopodia of this group became differentiated in
two ways, the firm axial threads of one section remaining very thin and
covered by protoplasm, whilst those of the other section became
metamorphosed into radial bars of acanthin. This hypothesis acquires more
probability from the regular distribution and arrangement of the axopodia
in the ACANTHARIA; they usually stand at fixed intervals {lxiv}between the
radial bars, singly or in groups; sometimes their number seems to be not
greater than that of the bars, whilst in other cases a circlet or group of
axopodia corresponds to each radial bar. Perhaps their fine axial thread
consists of acanthin. At all events the axopodia are constant organs
(probably sensory, like the "palpocils") and not retractile like the
movable myxopodia.

  The axial threads in the pseudopodia of the #Acanthometra# were first
  discovered by R. Hertwig, who accurately described their peculiar
  structure and arrangement (L. N. 33, pp. 16, 117).


96. _The Myophriscs of the Acanthometra._--The #Acanthometra# are
characterised by a very peculiar differentiation of the exoplasm, namely,
by the formation of myophriscs or contractile threads from the
sarcodictyum. In most (and perhaps in all) ACANTHARIA of this order each
radial bar is surrounded by a circlet of such contractile threads, which
was first described as a "ciliary corona" (see note A, below). The number
of contractile threads in each circlet usually amounts to from ten to
twenty, rarely being more than thirty and less than eight; it often appears
to be constant in the individual species (see note B). In the living state
the myophriscs are long, thin filaments, the pointed distal end of which is
inserted into the radial bar, whilst the thicker proximal end is attached
to the surface of the calymma, which is elevated round the base of each rod
into the form of a gelatinous cone or skeletal sheath (see note C).
Probably the myophriscs lie on the outer surface of the apical portion of
this gelatinous cone, and are hence to be regarded as exoplasmic threads
differentiated from the sarcodictyum. Sometimes, however (as in
_Acanthochiasma_), they fuse into a contractile membrane and form the
envelope of a cone, whose interior is occupied by a gelatinous papilla of
the calymma. On mechanical irritation the myophriscs contract rapidly and
suddenly, like muscle-fibrillæ, becoming at the same time thicker, and
hence are very different from pseudopodia. Their distal point of insertion
being fixed to the firm acanthin rod, they raise by their contraction the
skeletal sheath, to which their bases are attached or in the surface of
which they lie. The result of their contraction is therefore a distention
and increase in volume of the calymma, with which is no doubt connected an
inception of water into the gelatinous mass, and hence a diminution in its
specific gravity. Probably the #Acanthometra# contract their myophriscs
voluntarily when they wish to rise in the water; when these relax the
calymma collapses owing to its elasticity, water is then expelled and the
specific gravity increases. From a physiological point of view, then, the
myophriscs are to be regarded as a hydrostatic apparatus, morphologically
as myophanes or muscular fibrillæ, such as also occur in the intracapsular
protoplasm (see §§ 77-80). On more violent irritation and after the death
of the #Acanthometra# the myophriscs separate from the radial bars and
remain attached to the distal ends of the conical gelatinous sheaths as
free "ciliary coronas." At the same time, {lxv}they melt into short, thick,
hyaline rods, the so-called "gelatinous cilia." The myophriscs are found
only in the order #Acanthometra#, and are wanting in the #Acanthophracta#,
as well as in the other three legions of Radiolaria.

  A. The "_ciliary coronas_" on the skeletal rods of dead #Acanthometra#
  were first described by the discoverer of this order, Johannes Müller,
  and referred to as "the stumps of the contracted, thickened threads" (L.
  N. 12, p. 11, Taf. xi.).

  B. The "_number of the gelatinous cilia_" I found constant in certain
  species of #Acanthometra#, and stated in my Monograph (L. N. 16, p. 115)
  "that here is to be found the first differentiation of the diffuse
  sarcode into definite organs of regular definite number, size, and
  position, which deserve the name tentacles rather than pseudopodia."

  C.  The nature of the myophriscs as fibrillæ allied to muscles was first
  discovered by R. Hertwig, who described them as "structures of peculiar
  nature," under the name of "contractile threads," and pointed out in
  detail their histological and physiological peculiarities (L. N. 33, pp.
  16-19, Taf. i.).


97. _The Exoplasm of the Peripylea._--The extracapsular protoplasm of the
SPUMELLARIA or PERIPYLEA is in communication with the intracapsular sarcode
by the innumerable fine pores of the capsule-membrane, and like these pores
is evenly distributed over the whole surface. The sarcomatrix which
immediately surrounds the central capsule is moderately strong, and sends
out innumerable long, thin pseudopodia, which probably correspond to the
pores of the membrane. Their number is markedly greater in the SPUMELLARIA
than in the other three legions. The ramifications and communications which
the radiating fibres of the sarcomatrix undergo within the calymma,
apparently present the most manifold variations, so that the sarcoplegma or
intracalymmar network thus formed has very diverse forms. On the surface of
the calymma the exoplasmic threads constitute a variously disposed
sarcodictyum, a regular or irregular exoplasmic network, by the
silicification of which a primary lattice-shell arises in the majority of
the SPUMELLARIA. The free ends of the pseudopodia, which arise from this
extracalymmar network and radiate out into the water, appear in most
SPUMELLARIA to be relatively short, but exceedingly numerous. Specially
modified pseudopodia and axial threads in particular do not seem to occur
in this legion. Perhaps, however, among the latter may be reckoned the
remarkable pseudopodia which combine to form the sarcode flagellum in many
#Discoidea# (and perhaps in other SPUMELLARIA). This axoflagellum is a
particularly strong thread of sarcode, arising from a definite point in the
central capsule; it is cylindrical or slenderly conical in form, much
longer, stronger, and more contractile than the ordinary pseudopodia; it
contracts in a serpentine fashion on mechanical irritation and seems to
originate by the fusion of a bundle of pseudopodia (compare § 95, C).


98. _The Exoplasm of the Actipylea._--The extracapsular protoplasm of the
ACANTHARIA or ACTIPYLEA differs in several important respects from that of
other {lxvi}Radiolaria, and appears to undergo more significant
differentiations than that of the three other legions. Since the pores in
the wall of the central capsule are not distributed evenly and at equal
intervals over its whole surface (as in the PERIPYLEA), but rather exhibit
a regular disposition in groups at unequal intervals, the number of
projecting pseudopodia is much less and the law of their arrangement
different from that which obtains in the PERIPYLEA (§ 58). In many and
probably in all ACANTHARIA they are divided into two groups, those which
arise from the centre of the capsule and possess firm axial threads, and
those which have not these characters (compare § 95, A). The axopodia, or
stiff pseudopodia with axial threads, arise from the centre of the capsule,
are present in much smaller numbers than the soft and flexible myxopodia,
and are regularly disposed between the radial bars of acanthin, usually so
that they are as far removed from them as possible, _i.e._, in the centre
between each three or four bars; these latter may indeed be regarded as
strongly developed axial threads, which have become changed into acanthin
(§ 95, A). The soft myxopodia, or pseudopodia without axial threads, are
much more numerous than the others, and arise from the sarcodictyum or
exoplasmic network which ramifies over the surface of the calymma. Their
number and arrangement seem, however, in many (if not in all) ACANTHARIA to
be regular and not to possess the extraordinary variability seen in the
other three legions. In many #Acanthometra# the sarcodictyum exhibits a
symmetrical conformation, with regular or subregular, polygonal (mostly
hexagonal) meshes, and generally the stronger threads of the sarcodictyum
secrete a firm, homogeneous or fibrillar, striated substance, which forms a
network of ridges on the surface of the calymma. In the #Acanthophracta#
the place of this is taken by the acanthin network of the primary
lattice-shell. The axopodia of the #Acanthometra# are usually about as long
as the radial spines between which they stand; their stiff axial thread is
surrounded by a soft sheath of protoplasm, communicating with the thin
sarcomatrix which surrounds the central capsule. Numerous branches pass
into the calymma from the exoplasmic sheath of the axial threads, and form
by their interweaving a loose sarcoplegma. The most peculiar differentiated
products of the exoplasm of the ACANTHARIA, however, are the myophane
fibrillæ of the #Acanthometra#, which have already been described under the
name of myophriscs (§ 96).


99. _The Exoplasm of the Monopylea._--The extracapsular protoplasm of the
NASSELLARIA or MONOPYLEA arises only from the porochora, or the
intracapsular podoconus, the oral base of which is formed by this porous
area. The pseudopodia or protoplasmic threads which pass through the pores
of the latter, united into a bundle, are not very numerous (in most
NASSELLARIA probably between thirty and ninety), and unite just outside it
to form a thick discoid sarcomatrix; this covers the porochora completely
below, and spreads out in the form of a thin envelope of exoplasm over the
whole {lxvii}surface of the central capsule; at the apical portion of the
latter the sarcomatrix is often so thin that it can only be recognised by
the aid of reagents; it separates the membrane of the central capsule from
the surrounding calymma. The pseudopodia, which penetrate the latter and by
loose anastomoses from a wide-meshed sarcoplegma within it, are usually not
very numerous. The greater part of them radiate in a bunch downwards from
the basal disc of the sarcomatrix, and a smaller number arise from the
thinner envelope which covers the remainder of the central capsule (Pl. 51,
fig. 13; Pl. 65, fig. 1; Pl. 81, fig. 16). On the outer surface of the
calymma the collopodia, which have passed through it, unite to form the
sarcodictyum, and through the silicification of this the primary
lattice-shell arises in the great majority of the NASSELLARIA. From the
surface of the sarcodictyum arise the astropodia, or free pseudopodia which
radiate outwards into the water. Their number in most MONOPYLEA is
relatively small, but their length appears to be very great.


100. _The Exoplasm of the Cannopylea._--The extracapsular protoplasm of the
PHÆODARIA or CANNOPYLEA is much better developed as regards volume than in
the other three legions, and is connected with the intracapsular sarcode by
only a few apertures in the capsule-membrane. In most PHÆODARIA three of
these are present, the astropyle or main-opening at the oral pole of the
main axis, and the two lateral parapylæ or accessory openings on either
side of the aboral pole (§ 60). In several families the latter appear to be
wanting, whilst in others their number is increased; these families have
not yet, however, been observed during life. The protoplasm projects both
from the oral main-opening and from the two aboral accessory openings in
the form of a thick cylindrical rod; the tube into which each opening is
produced in many PHÆODARIA (longer in the case of the astropyle, shorter in
the parapylæ) being regarded as an excretion from this protoplasmic
cylinder. The sarcode threads within the tube appear like a bundle of
fibrils, either quite hyaline or finely striated. After issuing from the
mouth of the aperture they pass over into a thick sarcomatrix, which
surrounds the central capsule entirely and separates it from the enclosing
calymma. In the neighbourhood of the basal astropyle the sarcomatrix is
usually swollen into a thick lenticular disc, which is in direct contact
with the peculiar phæodium of this legion (§ 89). The pseudopodia, which
radiate from the sarcomatrix, and form by anastomosis a wide-meshed
sarcoplegma within the calymma, are usually not very numerous in the
PHÆODARIA, but are very strong. Sometimes two stronger bundles of
collopodia may be distinguished at the two poles of the main axis, an oral
bundle (in the direction of the proboscis of the astropyle) and an aboral
bundle (at the opposite pole between the parapylæ). The collopodia of the
sarcoplegma unite at the surface of the calymma into a regular or irregular
sarcodictyum, which, in most PHÆODARIA produces by the secretion of a
peculiar silicate the primary lattice-shell. {lxviii}The free astropodia,
which pass outwards from the sarcodictyum into the water, are in most
PHÆODARIA very numerous (Pl. 101, fig. 10). Since, however, only a few
species of this great legion have been observed in a living state, their
pseudopodia require further accurate examination.



CHAPTER IV.--THE SKELETON.

(§§ 101-140).

101. _The Significance of the Skeleton._--The skeleton of the Radiolaria is
developed in such exceedingly manifold and various shapes, and exhibits at
the same time such wonderful regularity and delicacy in its adjustments,
that in both these respects the present group of Protista excels all other
classes of the organic world. For, in spite of the fact that the
Radiolarian organism always remains merely a single cell, it shows the
potentiality of the highest complexity to which the process of skeleton
formation can be brought by a single cell. All that has been brought to
pass in this direction by single tissue-cells of animals and plants does
not attain the extremely high stage of development of the Radiolaria. Only
very few Rhizopoda of this very rich and varied class fail to exhibit the
power of forming this firm supporting and protecting organ--indeed, only
ten of the seven hundred and thirty-nine genera which are enrolled in the
list of the Challenger collection, namely, six genera of SPUMELLARIA (five
Thalassicollida, _Actissa_, _Thalassolampe_, _Thalassopila_,
_Thalassicolla_, _Thalassophysa_, Pl. 1, and one genus of Collozoida,
_Collozoum_, Pl. 3), and in addition two genera of NASSELLARIA (the
Nassellida, _Cystidium_ and _Nassella_, Pl. 91, fig. 1), and two genera of
PHÆODARIA (the Phæodinida, _Phæocolla_ and _Phæodina_, Pl. 101, figs. 1,
2). These skeletonless forms of Radiolaria are, however, of extreme
interest, since they include the original stem-forms of the whole class as
well as of its four legions. All Radiolaria which form skeletons have
originated from soft and skeletonless stem-forms by adaptation, and that
polyphyletically, for the skeletal types of the four legions have been
developed independently of each other (§ 108).


102. _The Chemical Peculiarities of the Skeleton._--The chemical
composition of the skeleton shows very marked variations in the different
legions of the Radiolaria. The two legions SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA
(united formerly as "Polycystina") form their skeleton of pure silica (see
note A, below); the legion PHÆODARIA of a silicate of carbon (see note B),
and the ACANTHARIA of a peculiar organic substance--acanthin (see note C).
This explains the well-known fact that the deposits of fossil Radiolaria
(or Polycystine marls) are composed exclusively of the skeletons of
SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, those of the ACANTHARIA and PHÆODARIA being
entirely absent (in the case of the last group, however, exception must be
made in favour of the Dictyochida, or those PHÆODARIA {lxix}whose skeleton
is made up of isolated scattered tangential siliceous fragments). The
enormous deposits of Radiolarian skeletons in the deep sea of today, which
constitute the Radiolarian ooze, consist, like the fossil Polycystine
marls, almost exclusively of the shells of SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA,
though here the acanthin skeletons of the ACANTHARIA may be present in very
small numbers, and the silicate skeletons of the PHÆODARIA, which offer
more resistance to the solvent action of sea-water, somewhat more
abundantly. Calcareous skeletons do not occur in the Radiolaria (see note
D).

  A. The pure siliceous skeletons of the Polycystina were first recognised
  in 1833 by Ehrenberg in chalky marls (L. N. 2, p. 117).  Since the two
  legions ACANTHARIA and PHÆODARIA were entirely unknown to Ehrenberg, his
  name Polycystina has reference only to the SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA.

  B. The silicate skeleton of the PHÆODARIA was formerly taken by me for a
  purely siliceous one. When I described the first PHÆODARIA in my
  Monograph in 1862, I was only acquainted with five genera and seven
  species, whilst the number of PHÆODARIA here described from the
  Challenger amounts to eighty-four genera and four hundred and sixty-five
  species. In the vast majority of these (though not in all) the skeleton
  becomes more or less intensely stained by carmine, and is also more or
  less charred at a red heat, in some even becoming of a blackish-brown. In
  many PHÆODARIA, furthermore, the hollow skeletal tubes are destroyed by
  the continued action of heat. They are also, for the most part, strongly
  acted upon, or even destroyed by boiling caustic alkalis, whilst boiling
  mineral acids have no effect upon them. The best method of cleaning the
  skeletons of PHÆODARIA from their soft parts is to heat them in
  concentrated sulphuric acid, and then add a drop of fuming nitric acid;
  in this they are not dissolved even on prolonged heating. From these
  facts it would appear that the skeletons of the PHÆODARIA consist of a
  compound of organic substance and silica, or a "carbonic silicate." The
  more intimate composition yet remains to be discovered, as also the
  manifold differences which the various families of PHÆODARIA seem to show
  in respect of its composition. The small skeletal fragments of the
  Dictyochida (the only remains of PHÆODARIA which occur as fossils) appear
  to consist of pure silica.

  C. The acanthin skeleton of the ACANTHARIA was first described as such in
  my Monograph (1862, pp. 30-32). Johannes Müller, the discoverer of this
  legion, took them for siliceous skeletons and defined the #Acanthometra#
  as "Radiolaria without lattice-shell, but with siliceous radial spines"
  (L. N. 12, p. 46). I formerly supposed that the acanthin skeletons in
  some of the ACANTHARIA were partially or wholly metamorphosed into
  siliceous skeletons, but, according to the investigations of R. Hertwig,
  this does not appear to be the case; he showed that the skeletons of the
  most varied #Acanthometra# and #Acanthophracta# are completely dissolved
  under the longer or shorter action of acids, and supposes that in all
  ACANTHARIA, without exception, the skeleton is composed of acanthin
  (1879, L. N. 33, p. 120). Quite recently Brandt has found that the
  acanthin spines dissolve not only in acids, alkalis, and "liquor
  conservativus" (as I had shown), but also in solutions of carbonate of
  soda (1 per cent.), and even of common salt (10 to 20 per cent.); he
  concludes from this that they consist of an albuminoid substance
  (vitellin) (L. N. 38, p. 400). I am unable to share this view, for I have
  never been able to see some of the most important reactions of albumen in
  any of the skeletons which I have examined, such for example as the
  xanthoproteic reaction, the red coloration with Millon's test, &c. They
  do not become {lxx}yellow either with nitric acid or with iodine. In
  dilute mineral acids they dissolve more rapidly than in concentrated. My
  usual method of cleansing the skeleton of ACANTHARIA (which has been
  practised with the same result on thousands of specimens) consists in
  heating the preparation in a small volume of concentrated sulphuric acid
  and then adding a drop of fuming nitric acid; all other constituents (the
  whole central capsule and the calymma) are thus very rapidly destroyed;
  the skeleton remains quite uninjured and withstands the combined action
  of the mineral acids for a longer or shorter time, though on prolonged
  heating it also is dissolved. I do not therefore regard acanthin as an
  albuminous substance, but as one related to chitin.

  D. Calcareous skeletons have not been certainly demonstrated in the
  Radiolaria, and probably do not occur. Sir Wyville Thomson in his
  Atlantic (1877, L. N. 31, vol. i. p. 233, fig. 51) described under the
  name _Calcaromma calcarea_, a Radiolarian which contained scattered in
  its calymma numerous calcareous corpuscles "resembling the rowels of
  spurs." These are identical with the "toothed bodies, recalling crystal
  balls," which Johannes Müller figured in the Mediterranean _Thalassicolla
  morum_ so early as 1858, and compared with the "siliceous asterisks of
  _Tethya_" (L. N. 12, p. 28, Taf. vii. figs. 1, 2). I formerly regarded
  these peculiar calcareous corpuscles, whose solubility in mineral acids I
  had observed, as spicules of a Thalassicollid, and hence described the
  species in my Monograph as _Thalassosphæra morum_ (L. N. 16, p. 260). I
  have, however, seen reason to change my view, and am now led to suppose
  that those peculiar calcareous corpuscles, which may be named
  "_Calcastrella_," are not formed by the Radiolarian itself, but are
  foreign bodies which have been accidentally incorporated into the calymma
  of a Thalassicollid (_Actissa_). These corpuscles occur, often in large
  numbers, in many preparations in the Challenger collection, and in the
  calymma of other Radiolaria, chiefly #Discoidea#, hence it would appear
  that they are foreign bodies taken up by the pseudopodia and carried into
  the calymma by the circulation of the sarcode. The Radiolaria which Sir
  Wyville Thomson figured as _Calcaromma calcarea_, and Müller as
  _Thalassicolla morum_, I regard as species of _Actissa_ (see p. 13),
  perhaps _Actissa radiata_ of the Pacific, and _Actissa primordialis_ of
  the Mediterranean (compare the description of the Thalassosphærida of the
  Challenger collection, pp. 30, 31).


103. _The Physical Properties of the Skeleton._--The skeletons of all
Radiolaria are characterised pre-eminently by a high degree of _firmness_,
which fits them to serve as protective and supporting apparatus. This is
obvious in the case of the pure siliceous shells of the Polycystina; but
the acanthin framework of the ACANTHARIA also possesses a degree of
stiffness but little inferior, whilst the silicate skeletons of the
PHÆODARIA seem on the whole to be not so firm. The hollow skeletal tubes of
the last-named, which are filled with gelatinous material, are very brittle
on account of the delicacy of their walls. Their _elasticity_ also is very
small, whilst that of the acanthin spines is considerable. The thin long
needles of many ACANTHARIA are very elastic, as are also the bristle-like
siliceous spicules of many SPUMELLARIA. The _refractive power_ of the
skeleton in the various legions is very different, depending upon the
chemical constitution. The siliceous skeleton of the Polycystina
(SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA) and the silicate skeleton of the PHÆODARIA
have the same refractive index as glycerine, and hence become invisible
when mounted in that fluid; they then become visible only on addition of
{lxxi}water, and are clearer in proportion to the quantity of water which
is added. The refractive index of acanthin is, however, very different from
that of glycerine, so that the skeletons of ACANTHARIA are readily visible
when mounted in this fluid. In water, the skeletons of all Radiolaria
appear about equally refractive, as also in Canada balsam. The substance of
the skeleton appears almost entirely hyaline, colourless, and transparent.
Very rarely it is faintly coloured (in some ACANTHARIA). A cloudy opaque
constitution is seen in some PHÆODARIA (especially in the "porcellanous
shells" of Tuscarorida and Circoporida, Pls. 100, 114-117); when dried,
these appear by reflected light milky-white or yellowish-white; the cause
of this opacity lies partly in the peculiar "cement-like structure" of
these porcellanous shells, partly in their fine porosity, and the minute
air-bubbles contained in their thick walls.


104. _The Elementary Structure of the Skeleton._--The general constitution
of the skeleton--or more accurately expressed, of the morphological
elements of which the skeleton consists--is of such a nature that it may be
termed structureless. Both the organic acanthin skeletons of the ACANTHARIA
and the silicate skeletons of the PHÆODARIA, as well as the inorganic
siliceous skeletons of the SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, appear under the
microscope perfectly homogeneous, transparent, colourless, and crystalline.
Only very rarely do they show traces of a concentric striation, which
arises from the deposition of the skeletal substance in layers; as, for
example, the thick spines of some PHÆODARIA (Pls. 105-107, &c.). Some of
the PHÆODARIA, however, form an exception to this rule, inasmuch as their
partially tubular skeletal elements possess a remarkable porcellanous
structure. In the tubular or Cannoid skeleton, which occurs in most
CANNOPYLEA, the lumen of the thin-walled flinty tube is filled with jelly,
and frequently a thin siliceous thread runs in its axis, and is connected
with the wall by transverse threads (§§ 127, 139). The elementary structure
of the opaque porcellanous shells, which distinguish the two families
Circoporida (Pls. 114-117) and Tuscarorida (Pl. 100), is quite peculiar.
Numerous fine siliceous spicules lie scattered irregularly in a finely
granular or porous matrix.


105. _Complete and Incomplete Lattice-Shells._--In the great majority of
Radiolaria (in all four legions) the skeleton has the form of a delicate
lattice-shell or a receptacle in which the central capsule is enclosed. In
a small minority, however, this is not the case. The skeleton then consists
only of isolated rigid pieces (radial or tangential spicules), or of a
simple ring (sagittal ring of the #Stephoidea#), or of a basal tripod with
or without a loose tissue of trabeculæ, &c. (#Plectoidea#); the central
capsule is then not surrounded by a special latticed receptacle, but only
rests upon the skeletal trabeculæ. According to these different
arrangements, two principal groups or sublegions may be distinguished in
each legion, of which one set (Cataphracta) are characterised by a complete
{lxxii}lattice-shell, whilst the others (Aphracta) are without it. The
RADIOLARIA APHRACTA, then, or Radiolaria without a complete skeleton, are
the #Collodaria# (p. 9), the #Acanthometra# (p. 725), the #Plectellaria#
(p. 895), and the #Phæocystina# (p. 1543). On the other hand, the
RADIOLARIA CATAPHRACTA, or Radiolaria with a complete skeleton, are the
#Sphærellaria# (p. 49), the #Acanthophracta# (p. 791), the #Cyrtellaria#
(p. 1015), and the #Phæocoscina# (p. 1590).

  Upon this basis the first subdivision of the Radiolaria was made by
  Johannes Müller, who recognised three groups:--"I. _Thalassicolla_,
  without receptacle, naked or with spicules; II. _Polycystina_, with a
  siliceous receptacle; III. _Acanthometra_, without receptacle, but with
  siliceous radial spines" (L. N. 12, p. 16).


106. _The Ectolithia and Entolithia (Extracapsular and Intracapsular
Skeletons)._--The relation of the skeleton to the central capsule in the
Radiolaria is very various in many respects; in the first instance two
great groups, _Ectolithia_ and _Entolithia_ (see note A), may be
distinguished topographically by mere external observation; in the former
the skeleton lies entirely outside the central capsule; in the latter,
partially at all events, within it. The _Ectolithia_, with a completely
extracapsular skeleton, include all NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA, as well as a
great part of the SPUMELLARIA (all #Collodaria# and the most archaic forms
of #Sphærellaria#); the _Entolithia_, on the other hand, in which the
skeleton lies partly within, partly without the central capsule, include
all ACANTHARIA and the majority of the SPUMELLARIA (most #Sphærellaria#,
see note B).

  A. The difference between Ectolithia and Entolithia was applied in my
  Monograph in 1862 (p. 222) to separate the Monocyttaria into two main
  groups. The arrangement was, however, quite artificial, being contrary to
  the natural relations of the larger groups, as was shown seventeen years
  later by the discovery of the different structural relations of the
  central capsule.

  B. Among the ACANTHARIA, which all possess primitively an intracapsular
  and centrogenous skeleton, the remarkable _Cenocapsa_ (Pl. 133, fig. 11),
  seems to furnish the single exception; in it the skeleton consists of a
  simple spherical shell which encloses the concentric central capsule. The
  exception is, however, only apparent; the twenty perspinal pores of the
  shell show that they were originally in connection with twenty
  centrogenous acanthin spines, and that those have disappeared by
  retrograde metamorphosis.


107. _Perigenous and Centrogenous Skeletons._--Much more important than the
topographical relation of the skeleton to the central capsule, according to
which the Ectolithia and Entolithia are separated from each other (§ 106),
is the original development of the skeleton within or without the central
capsule, which gives rise to the distinction between perigenous and
centrogenous skeletons. _Centrogenous skeletons_ are found only in the
ACANTHARIA, which are further distinguished from all other Radiolaria by
their skeleton being formed of acanthin; in all ACANTHARIA the formation of
the skeleton begins in the middle of the central capsule, from which twenty
(the number is inconstant only in the {lxxiii}small group #Actinelida#)
radial spines are centrifugally developed. The three other legions, on the
contrary, possess on the whole a _perigenous_ skeleton, which _originally_
develops outside the central capsule and never in its middle. In the
NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA the skeleton retains this extracapsular position,
as also in the #Beloidea# and part of the #Sphærellaria# among the
SPUMELLARIA; in the great majority of the latter, however, the primary
perigenous skeleton is subsequently enveloped by the growing central
capsule, so that it lies partially within it (§ 109).


108. _Polyphyletic Origin of the Skeleton._--The skeleton of the Radiolaria
has undoubtedly originated polyphyletically, for it is impossible to derive
its manifold varieties from a single ground-form, or to regard them as
modifications of one type. It is much more probable that the different
skeletonless Radiolaria have entered upon different ways of skeleton
formation quite independently of each other. At the outset it is quite
clear that the skeletons of the _four legions have originated independently
of each other_. Further, it is certain that within the legion of the
SPUMELLARIA the Beloid skeletons of the #Collodaria# are not connected with
the Sphæroid skeletons of the #Sphærellaria# and the forms derived from
them (see § 109). In the same way the skeletons of the PHÆODARIA are
polyphyletic; probably in this legion the Beloid, Sphæroid, Cyrtoid, and
Conchoid skeletons have been developed quite independently (see § 112). In
the NASSELLARIA, on the other hand, it is possible that all the skeletal
forms are to be derived monophyletically from a single simple primitive
form (either the sagittal ring or basal tripod?) (see § 111). Still more
probable is it that the ACANTHARIA have arisen monophyletically, for all
the forms of their acanthin skeleton may be derived without violence from
_Actinelius_ (see § 110).


109. _The Skeleton of the Spumellaria._--The skeletons of the SPUMELLARIA
or PERIPYLEA consist of silica, and are very different and of independent
origin in the two orders of this legion. The first order, #Collodaria#,
have either no skeleton whatever (#Colloidea#, p. 10, Pls. 1, 3), or their
skeleton is _Beloid_, a loose extracapsular envelope of spicules,
consisting of numerous unconnected portions; the separate parts are usually
disposed tangentially, either as simple or compound siliceous spicules
(#Beloidea#, p. 28, Pls. 2, 4). The second order of SPUMELLARIA, on the
other hand (#Sphærellaria#, p. 49), develops a siliceous lattice-shell
which consists of a single piece, and is remarkable for the extraordinary
variety of its forms (pp. 50-715, Pls. 5-50). To this order belong not less
than three hundred genera and seventeen hundred species of the Challenger
Radiolaria (that is, about two-fifths of all the genera and species). In
spite of this extreme richness in different forms this large group must be
regarded as _monophyletic_, since all its forms may be quite naturally
derived from a common stem-form, a _simple lattice-sphere_ (_Cenosphæra_,
p. 61, Pl. 2). The twenty-eight families of #Sphærellaria# may be
distributed in four suborders, among which the #Sphæroidea# constitute the
{lxxiv}stem-forms, since they retain the original spherical shape (Pls.
5-8, 11-30). In the other three suborders a vertical main axis is
developed, which in #Prunoidea# is longer, in #Discoidea# shorter than the
other axes of the shell. Hence the shell of the #Prunoidea# (p. 284, Pls.
13, _bis_, 17, 39, 40) is ellipsoidal or cylindrical, that of the
#Discoidea#, on the other hand, lenticular or discoidal (p. 402, Pls.
31-38, 41-48). Finally, the shell of the fourth suborder, #Larcoidea#, is
lentelliptical; it has the ground-form of a triaxial ellipsoid, and is
characterised by the possession of three unequal dimensive axes, or three
isopolar axes of different lengths perpendicular to each other (p. 599,
Pls. 9, 10, 49, 50).


110. _The Skeleton of the Acantharia._--The skeletons of the ACANTHARIA or
ACTIPYLEA are distinguished from those of all other Radiolaria by two very
important peculiarities; in the first place, they consist not of silica but
of a peculiar organic substance, _Acanthin_, and secondly, their
development is centrogenous, numerous radial spines or acanthin spicules
being formed which are united in the middle of the central capsule. Hence
the ACANTHARIA are the only Radiolaria in which the skeleton originates
from the first in the middle of the central capsule. The number of radial
spines is primitively indefinite, variable, and often considerable (more
than a hundred), but in the great majority it is limited to twenty. In
accordance with this the legion may be divided into two orders, the more
archaic small group Adelacantha, with an indefinite number of spines, and
the more recent group, Icosacantha, which has been developed from them and
possesses twenty regularly disposed spines; of the three hundred and
seventy-two species of ACANTHARIA which have been hitherto described, about
five per cent. belong to the former, about ninety-five per cent. to the
latter division (see note A, below). The numerous genera of Icosacantha may
then be again divided into two suborders, of which the #Acanthonida# (p.
740, Pls. 130-132) produce no complete lattice-shell, and thus agree with
the #Actinelida#, with which they may be united as #Acanthometra# in the
broader sense (or ACANTHARIA without a lattice-shell). The
#Acanthophracta#, on the other hand (p. 791, Pls. 133-140), produce a
complete lattice-shell, usually by means of two opposite or four crossed
transverse processes, which arise from each radial spine and unite with
each other (see note B, below). In most #Acanthophracta# the lattice-shell
remains single; only in the Phractopeltida does it consist of two
concentric lattice-spheres (p. 847, Pl. 133, figs. 1-6). Furthermore, the
whole order #Acanthophracta# may be subdivided into two suborders according
to the different ground-form of the lattice-shell; this remains spherical
in the #Sphærophracta# (the three families Sphærocapsida, Dorataspida,
Phractopeltida, Pls. 133-138). On the other hand, it assumes another form
in the #Prunophracta#; it becomes ellipsoidal in the Belonaspida (Pl. 136,
figs. 6-9), discoidal or lentiform in the Hexalaspida (Pl. 139); and
finally takes the shape of a double cone in the Diploconida (Pl. 140).

  {lxxv}A.  The group Adelacantha consists only of the suborder
  #Actinelida#, with the three families Astrolophida, Litholophida, and
  Chiastolida (p. 728, Pl. 129, figs. 1-3); the number of the radial spines
  is very different and variable, sometimes only from ten to sixteen, but
  usually from thirty to fifty, and often more than one hundred; they are
  generally irregularly distributed, and not as in the second main
  division. This latter, the Icosacantha, always possesses _twenty_ radial
  spines, which are regularly disposed according to a constant law, the
  so-called "Müllerian" or "Icosacanthan" law; the twenty spines are always
  so placed between the poles of a spineless axis that they form five zones
  each of four spines; the four spines of each zone are equidistant from
  each other, and also from the same pole, and alternate with those of the
  neighbouring zones, so that the whole twenty lie in four meridian planes,
  which cut out an angle of 45° (compare pp. 717-722, Pls. 130-140). In
  spite of the manifold variations in form which are developed in the
  Icosacantha, they may all be derived from a common stem-form,
  _Acanthometron_ (p. 742), since the law of distribution of the twenty
  spines is constantly inherited.

  B.  An exception is found in the peculiar family Sphærocapsida (p. 797,
  Pl. 133, figs. 7-11; Pl. 135, figs. 6-10). Here the shell is composed of
  innumerable small, perforated plates, which arise on the surface of the
  calymma independently of the spines.


111. _The Skeleton of the Nassellaria._--The skeletons of the NASSELLARIA
or MONOPYLEA consist of silica, and are never composed of separate
portions, but constitute always a single continuous piece. The ground-form
is originally monaxon, corresponding to that of the central capsule, with a
constant difference between the two poles of the vertical main axis. The
ground-form is never spherical or polyaxon as in the lattice-shells of the
SPUMELLARIA, and the skeleton never consists of hollow tubes, as in the
PHÆODARIA. The legion NASSELLARIA may be divided into two orders; in the
#Plectellaria# (three suborders #Nassoidea#, #Plectoidea#, #Stephoidea#)
the skeleton does not form a complete lattice-shell; in the #Cyrtellaria#,
on the other hand, which are derived from these, the siliceous skeleton
forms a complete lattice-shell enclosing the central capsule. The number of
forms thus developed is astonishingly great, so that among the NASSELLARIA
no less than two hundred and seventy-four genera and sixteen hundred and
eighty-seven species may be distinguished, almost as many as in the
#Sphærellaria#. In spite of this great variety of forms the legion
MONOPYLEA is probably monophyletic; at least all the different skeletal
forms may be derived from three elements which are combined in the most
manifold fashion; (1) the _sagittal ring_, a simple siliceous ring, which
lies vertically in the sagittal plane of the body, encircles the central
capsule and comes into contact with it at the basal pole of the main axis
(§ 124); (2) the _basal or oral tripod_, composed of three diverging radial
spines, which meet in the middle of the basal pole of the central capsule
(or in the centre of the porochora) (§ 125); (3) the _cephalis_, or
lattice-head, a simple ovoid or subspherical lattice-shell, which encloses
the central capsule and stands in connection with it at the basal pole of
its main axis. Any one of these three important structural elements of the
NASSELLARIAN skeleton may possibly be the starting-point {lxxvi}for all the
remaining forms of the MONOPYLEA; the great difficulty in their
phylogenetic derivation lies in the facts that, on the one hand, any one of
the three elements may alone constitute the skeleton, and on the other
hand, in the great majority of the legion, two or three are united together
(compare §§ 182-185).


112. _The Skeleton of the Phæodaria._--The skeleton of the PHÆODARIA or
CANNOPYLEA is always extracapsular, usually consists of a silicate of
carbon (more rarely of pure silica), and in the majority of the legion is
composed of hollow cylindrical tubes, whose siliceous wall is very thin,
and whose lumen is filled with gelatinous material (§ 127). The manifold
and remarkable skeletal forms occurring in this legion are not
monophyletic, since they cannot be derived from a common stem-form; they
are, on the contrary, polyphyletic, various skeletonless PHÆODARIA
(Phæodinida) have independently acquired skeletons of different form and
composition. The legion PHÆODARIA can be subdivided into four orders, the
skeletons of which present the following important distinctions:--(1) The
#Phæocystina# possess only incomplete Beloid skeletons (§ 115), composed of
many separate pieces, sometimes tangentially (Cannorrhaphida, Pl. 101),
sometimes radially arranged (Aulacanthida, Pls. 102-105). (2) The
#Phæosphæria# form Sphæroid skeletons (§ 116), usually only a simple
lattice-shell without special aperture (Pls. 106-111); two concentric
shells united by radial bars occur only in the Cannosphærida (Pl. 112). (3)
The #Phæogromia# are distinguished by the formation of a simple Cyrtoid
skeleton (§ 123) resembling that of the Monocyrtida; the monothalamus
lattice-shell is usually ovoid or helmet-shaped, more rarely polyhedral or
almost spherical; a vertical main axis can always be distinguished, at the
basal pole of which is an aperture usually armed with teeth or spines (Pls.
99, 100, 113-120). (4) The #Phæoconchia# are distinguished from all other
Radiolaria by the possession of a bivalved shell like that of the
Conchifera; the two valves of this Conchoid skeleton must be distinguished
as dorsal and ventral, as in the Brachiopoda (Pls. 121-128). The fifteen
families of PHÆODARIA which are arranged in the four orders just mentioned,
present such great differences among themselves, that the skeleton must be
regarded as probably polyphyletic even within the limits of each order.


113. _Types of Skeletal Formation._--No less than twelve different
principal forms may be distinguished as morphological types of the
formation of the skeleton in the Radiolaria; some of these are peculiar to
a single legion or even to a smaller group; but sometimes the same form
occurs in several legions. Some types occur only in an isolated manner,
independently of the others, but most exist in various combinations with
other types. Of the twelve described below the Conchoid and Cannoid occur
only in the PHÆODARIA; the Plectoid and Circoid only in the NASSELLARIA;
the Astroid only in the ACANTHARIA; the remaining seven types are found in
several legions in the same form and hence are polyphyletic.


{lxxvii}114. _The Astroid Skeleton._--Under the name "Astroid" we place the
peculiar star-shaped skeletons of the ACANTHARIA in opposition to those of
all other Radiolaria, for they are separated from them not only
fundamentally by reason of the chemical nature of their substance
(Acanthin, § 102), but also by their centrogenous origin, and the resulting
stellate form (Pls. 129-140). The ACANTHARIA are the only Radiolaria in
which the skeleton arises within the central capsule by the formation of
numerous rays or radial spines of acanthin which project on all sides from
the centre. Originally these are united at this point, their conical or
pyramidal points meeting and being supported one upon another. In the great
majority of ACANTHARIA this loose apposition is constant, so that when the
soft parts are destroyed the skeleton falls to pieces. Only in a few forms
in this legion are the central ends of the spines fused so that the whole
skeleton forms a connected star (_Astrolithium_). The small group
Chiastolida (or Acanthochiasmida) is characterised by the fact that the two
rays which are opposite to one another in each axis unite and form a
diametral bar. The skeleton is almost always composed of twenty radial
spines, which are regularly disposed (Icosacantha), only in the small
primitive group #Actinelida# is the number variable (Adelacantha, § 110).


115. _The Beloid Skeleton._--As Beloid or spicular skeletons are grouped
together all those which consist of several disconnected portions; these
always lie outside the central capsule, either within the calymma or on its
surface. Such extracapsular Beloid skeletons are entirely wanting in the
ACANTHARIA and NASSELLARIA; they occur only in the #Beloidea# among the
SPUMELLARIA, and in the #Phæocystina# among the PHÆODARIA; the individual
Beloid portions of the former are solid, those of the latter hollow. In
both groups the simplest forms of the separate portions are simple
unbranched needles (_Thalassosphæra_, _Thalassoplancta_, _Physematium_,
_Belonozoum_, among the SPUMELLARIA; _Cannobelos_ and _Cannorrhaphis_ among
the PHÆODARIA); usually these spicules are disposed tangentially over the
surface of the calymma. Among the #Beloidea# branched spicules occur more
commonly than these simple ones; they are either stellate (with many rays
united in a centre) or twin-like, with a tangential bar, from each pole of
which two or three (seldom more) radial branches project (Pls. 2, 4). Among
the PHÆODARIA the subfamily Dictyochida is characterised by the annular
shape of its Beloid portions, either simple rings, or hat-shaped or
pyramidal bodies with a latticed cap over the ring (Pl. 101, figs. 3-14;
Pl. 114, figs. 7-13). The family Aulacanthida among the PHÆODARIA, alone
possesses hollow _radial tubes_, which penetrate the whole calymma, and
project distally over its surface, whilst their proximal ends rest upon the
surface of the central capsule. Although in these cases the enclosed
proximal end is always simple, the free distal end develops the most
various processes in adaptation to its prehensile functions (Pls. 102-105).


{lxxviii}116. _The Sphæroid Skeletons or Lattice-Spheres._--The
"lattice-spheres" or sphæroid skeletons are the simplest and most primitive
forms of lattice shells, and are widely distributed in the three legions
SPUMELLARIA, ACANTHARIA, and PHÆODARIA, whilst they are entirely wanting in
the NASSELLARIA. The round lattice-shell is either a true sphere in the
geometrical sense, or an endospherical polyhedron, _i.e._, a polyhedron,
all whose angles lie in the surface of a sphere (§ 25). In general,
_primary_ and _secondary_ lattice-spheres may be distinguished, of which
the former are secreted on the outer surface of the primary, the latter on
that of the secondary calymma (§ 85). Furthermore, _simple_ and _compound_
lattice-spheres may be distinguished, the latter of which consist of two or
more concentric lattice-spheres firmly united by radial bars; in such cases
the innermost lattice-sphere is always to be regarded as the oldest or
primary, all the succeeding ones as secondary, and the outermost as the
youngest (§ 129). The simple lattice-spheres are usually to be regarded as
primary; they may, however, occasionally be secondary, in which case the
primary shell, originally enclosed, has been lost by degeneration (as, for
example, in the case of the Aulosphærida and some #Sphærellaria#).


117. _The Lattice-Spheres of the Spumellaria._--The lattice-spheres or
Sphæroid skeletons of the SPUMELLARIA exhibit in spite of their simple type
of structure, an extraordinary variety in the formation of the lattice-work
and radial apophyses, so that in the systematic portion of this work no
less than one hundred and seven genera and six hundred and fifty species
are distinguished; these are united in one suborder, the #Sphæroidea# (pp.
50-284, Pls. 5-8, 11-30). It may be divided into two main divisions, the
_Monosphærida_ with a single primary lattice-sphere (Pls. 12-14, 21, 26,
27), and _Pliosphærida_ (or Sphæroidea concentrica) whose skeleton consists
of two or more concentric lattice-spheres united by radial bars. The latter
are subdivided into Dyosphærida with two concentric lattice-spheres (Pls.
16, 19, 20, 22, 28); Triosphærida, with three spheres (Pls. 17, 24, 29);
Tetrasphærida, with four (Pls. 23, 30); Polysphærida, with five or more
(Pls. 15, 23); and Spongosphærida, with spongy lattice-spheres (Pls. 18,
25). A special group is made up of the simple lattice-spheres of the social
Collosphærida (or Sphæroidea polyzoa) (Pls. 5-8); these are usually more or
less irregular, and characterised by the development of peculiar tubular
processes; the latter are generally wanting in the Sphæroidea monozoa,
whose lattice-shell is very regularly formed. This distinction is
interesting and important, inasmuch as the regular lattice-spheres are
explained by the independent development of the free-swimming Monozoa,
whilst the irregular spheres are due to the mutual dependence of the social
Polyzoa.


118. _The Lattice-Spheres of the Acantharia._--The lattice-shells or
Sphæroid skeletons of the ACANTHARIA are immediately distinguishable from
those of all other Radiolaria by their centrogenous development and the
central union of the radial spines by which they are supported; the only
exception is furnished by the remarkable genus _Cenocapsa_ {lxxix}(Pl. 133,
fig. 11), in which the radial spines are absent, not primitively, however,
but in consequence of degeneration; for the twenty cross-shaped perspinal
pores, originally due to the twenty radial spines, are still present. In
the most nearly allied genera, _Porocapsa_ (Pl. 133, fig. 7) and
_Cannocapsa_ (Pl. 133, fig. 8), the proximal part of the twenty radial
spines is still present, while their distal portion has degenerated; hence
in this case they do not stand in direct communication with the spherical
shell. On the other hand, this primitive connection persists in the genera
_Astrocapsa_ (Pl. 133, figs. 9, 10), and _Sphærocapsa_ (Pl. 135, figs.
6-10). The five genera just mentioned form the peculiar family
Sphærocapsida (pp. 795-802); the spherical shell is in these cases composed
of very numerous small plates disposed like a pavement, each plate or aglet
being perforated by a pore canal; in addition to which there are twenty
larger (perspinal) pores (or twenty cross-shaped groups each of four
aspinal pores) at those important points where primitively the twenty
radial spines penetrate the calymma. This peculiar porous "pavement shell"
has probably been developed (independently of the twenty radial spines)
upon the calymma of the #Acanthonida# (_Acanthonia_, p. 749) by the action
of the sarcodictyum; it has, therefore, quite a different morphological
significance from the spherical lattice-shell of the Dorataspida, which is
composed of tangential apophyses of the twenty Acanthonid spines (pp.
802-847, Pls. 134-138). Each radial spine here forms either two opposite or
four crossed transverse processes, and since their branches spread over the
surface of the spherical calymma and are united suturally at their
extremities, the peculiar lattice-sphere of the Dorataspida arises. This
extensive family is again divided into two subfamilies:--the Diporaspida
(Pls. 137, 138) possess always only two opposite apophyses, and form by the
union of their branches two opposite primary apertures or aspinal meshes.
The Tessaraspida, on the other hand (Pls. 135, 138), have always four
crossed transverse processes, and form by their union four primary aspinal
meshes. From the Diporaspida are probably to be derived the Phractopeltida
(p. 847, Pl. 133, figs. 1-6), the only ACANTHARIA which possess a double
lattice-sphere; their double concentric spherical shell may be compared
with that of the Dyosphærida.


119. _The Lattice-Spheres of the Phæodaria._--The lattice-spheres or
Sphæroid skeletons of the PHÆODARIA, which are generally developed quite
regularly, though occasionally in a modified form, fall in the order
#Phæosphæria# into two groups of very different structure, each of which
includes two families. The first group (_Phæosphæria inarticulata_)
contains the families Orosphærida (Pls. 106, 107) and Sagosphærida (Pl.
108); the lattice-work of the former consists of irregular polygonal meshes
and very coarse, partially hollow trabeculæ; in the latter, on the other
hand, it consists of triangular meshes and very slender filiform trabeculæ;
in both families the whole sphæroid skeleton forms a single unsegmented
piece as in most #Sphæroidea#. In the second group of {lxxx}#Phæosphæria#
(_Phæosphæria articulata_), on the other hand, the lattice-sphere is
segmented in quite a peculiar manner, and composed of hollow cylindrical
tangential tubes, which are separated by astral septa at the nodal points
of the network; this remarkable structure characterises the two families,
Aulosphærida (Pls. 109-111) and Cannosphærida (Pl. 112); the segmented
lattice-sphere of the former is simple and hollow; while that of the latter
is connected by centripetal radial tubes with a simple concentric inner
shell, which is sometimes solid, sometimes latticed, and provided with a
main-opening corresponding to the astropyle of the enclosed central
capsule. Since in the Aulosphærida also, hollow centripetal radial tubes
project from the segmented lattice-sphere, it is possible that they have
been derived from the Cannosphærida by the loss of the primitive internal
shell. A special peculiarity of many #Phæosphæria# (_Oroscena_,
_Sagoscena_, _Auloscena_, &c.) consists in the fact that the whole surface
of the lattice-sphere is regularly covered with pyramidal or tent-shaped
prominences (Pl. 106, fig. 4; Pl. 108, fig. 1; Pl. 110, fig. 1). A simple
lattice-sphere quite similar to that of most Monosphærida also constitutes
the skeleton of the Castanellida (Pl. 113), but since it possesses a
special main-opening, it must be referred promorphologically to the Cyrtoid
shells of the #Phæogromia#.


120. _The Prunoid Skeleton or Lattice-Ellipsoid._--The "lattice-ellipsoids"
or Prunoid skeletons have arisen from the lattice-spheres or Sphæroid
skeletons by more energetic growth and elongation of one axis; this is the
main axis of the body and is probably always vertical; its two poles are
commonly equal. The Prunoid skeleton is either a true ellipsoid in the
geometrical sense or an "endellipsoidal polyhedron" (_i.e._, a polyhedron,
all the angles of which lie in an ellipsoidal surface). By further
elongation of the main axis, the ellipsoidal form passes over into the
cylindrical, the polar surfaces of the cylinder being usually rounded,
rarely truncated. The rich order #Prunoidea# (pp. 284-402) contains
numerous modifications of this form of shell which arise on the one hand by
the formation of transverse constrictions, on the other by the apposition
of concentric secondary shells. In respect of the latter, simple and
compound Prunoid shells can be distinguished as in the case of the Sphæroid
shells. In the compound Prunoid shells either all the concentric
lattice-shells may be ellipsoidal or the inner may be spherical. More
important differences are found in the transverse annular constrictions,
which give the Prunoid skeleton a segmented appearance; in this respect,
three principal forms may be distinguished (p. 288):--(A) _Monoprunida_,
with unsegmented shell, having no transverse constriction (Pls. 15-17); (B)
_Dyoprunida_, having a shell with two segments and one (equatorial)
transverse constriction (Pl. 39); (C) _Polyprunida_, with three or more
parallel transverse constrictions, by means of which the shell is divided
into four or more segments (Pl. 40). In the same manner as the #Prunoidea#
have arisen from the #Sphæroidea# among the SPUMELLARIA by greater
{lxxxi}development of the vertical main axis, the ellipsoidal Belonaspida
have arisen from the spherical Dorataspida among the ACANTHARIA (p. 859;
Pl. 136, figs. 6-9; Pl. 139, figs. 8, 9). The main axis of the ellipsoid in
this case is always occupied by the opposite equatorial spines of the
hydrotomical axis (pp. 719, 860). In the legion PHÆODARIA a similar
prolongation of the main axis rarely occurs; it is found, however, in
_Aulatractus_ (Pl. 111, figs. 6, 7), the lattice-shell of this Aulosphærid
being sometimes truly fusiform, sometimes rather ellipsoidal or even
double-conical.


121. _The Discoid Skeletons or Lattice-Discs._--The "lattice-discs" or
Discoid skeletons are characteristic of the SPUMELLARIAN group #Discoidea#,
and have arisen from the lattice-spheres of the #Sphæroidea# by a less
development of one axis, which is the main axis of the body, and is
probably usually vertical; its two poles are always equal. The Discoid
lattice-shell is either a biconvex lens (with a thin margin), or a plane
disc (a shortened cylinder with thick margin), or some form intermediate
between the two. All Discoid shells show a horizontal median plane or
equatorial plane, by which they are divided into two equal halves, an upper
and lower; the margin of the lens itself is originally the equator. The
main axis, the shortest of all the axes of the shell, stands vertically in
the centre of the equatorial plane. Among the PHÆODARIA Discoid shells
rarely occur (_Aulophacus_), as also among the ACANTHARIA (Hexalaspida).


122. _The Larcoid Skeleton or Lentelliptical Lattice-Shell._--The
lentelliptical lattice-shells, which may be shortly designated "Larcoid,"
are especially characteristic of the #Larcoidea#, a large order of
SPUMELLARIA (pp. 599-715; Pls. 9, 10, 49, 50). In addition they recur among
the ACANTHARIA, in the small family Hexalaspida (p. 872, Pl. 139), and the
family Diploconida (p. 881, Pl. 140), which is derived from it. These
lentelliptical lattice-shells are all characterised by the clear
differentiation of three unequal, but isopolar dimensive axes, _i.e._, the
three geometrical axes, perpendicular to one another, which determine the
form of the shell, are of unequal length; the two poles of each are,
however, equal. The geometrical ground-form is, therefore, a triaxial
ellipsoid (§ 34). In the rich order #Larcoidea# the lentelliptical
lattice-shell shows many variations in its development.


123. _The Cyrtoid Skeleton._--Cyrtoid skeletons are those lattice-shells
which possess a vertical main axis with two different poles (Monaxonia
allopola); the upper pole is usually termed the apical, the lower the
basal. Such Cyrtoid shells are characteristic of the great majority of the
NASSELLARIA or MONOPYLEA (and especially of the #Cyrtellaria#); they are
also found in a large division of the PHÆODARIA (the #Phæogromia#), and in
some SPUMELLARIA. In general the manifold Cyrtoid shells may be divided
into two large groups, those with one and those with several chambers. The
_monothalamous_ Cyrtoid shells are usually ovoid, conical, cap- or
helmet-shaped; their {lxxxii}internal cavity is simple, without
constrictions or septa. Among the NASSELLARIA they occur in the Monocyrtida
(Pls. 51-54, 98), where they have received the name "Cephalis." A form of
shell, essentially the same, is found amongst the PHÆODARIA in the order
#Phæogromia#, more especially in the Challengerida (Pl. 99), Medusettida
(Pls. 118-120), and Tuscarorida (Pl. 100), many of these latter closely
resembling many Monocyrtida. Such monothalamous Cyrtoid shells occur much
more rarely among the SPUMELLARIA (_e.g._, among the #Prunoidea# in
_Lithapium_, _Lithomespilus_, _Druppatractus_, Pls. 13, 14, &c.).
Polythalamous Cyrtoid shells (Pls. 55-80) occur exclusively in the
NASSELLARIA, and exhibit in this legion an astonishing variety of
structure; they are distinguished from the monothalamous forms by the
development of internal septa, or of annular incomplete diaphragms, which
usually correspond to the external constrictions; their interior is thus
divided into two or more communicating compartments. Among the
polythalamous Cyrtoid shells may be distinguished three principal groups,
the Stichocyrtid, Zygocyrtid, and Polycyrtid. Zygocyrtid shells are
characteristic of the #Spyroidea# (Pls. 84-90), and are distinguished by a
bilobate cephalis (cephalis bilocularis); the median sagittal ring, or a
corresponding constriction, divides the shell into right and left
compartments. Polycyrtid shells (Pl. 96) are peculiar to the #Botryodea#,
and characterised by a multilobate cephalis (cephalis multilocularis).
Stichocyrtid shells are those in which the primary cephalis remains simple,
and new joints are successively added to its basal pole; such shells occur
in the majority of the #Cyrtoidea#. Secondary chambers are sometimes added
in the other two groups (#Botryodea# and #Spyroidea#). When, as often
happens in these polythalamous Cyrtoid shells, two or three distinct joints
follow each other, the first is called the "cephalis," the second the
"thorax," and the third the "abdomen" (Tricyrtida Pls. 64-75).


124. _The Circoid Skeleton._--This is a very important and remarkable type
of skeletal formation, which occurs exclusively in the legion NASSELLARIA,
where it plays a very prominent part; its characteristic element is the
"sagittal ring," a simple, vertical, siliceous ring, which surrounds the
central capsule in its sagittal plane, and is specially differentiated in
its basal portion. This "primary sagittal ring" whose vertical allopolar
main axis coincides with that of the Monopylean central capsule embraced by
it, is characteristic of all members of the order #Stephoidea# (p. 931,
Pls. 81-83, 92-94); here it forms by itself the skeleton of the Stephanida
(Pl. 81); in the Semantida (Pl. 92) it is combined with a horizontal basal
ring, in the Coronida (Pls. 82, 93) with a vertical frontal ring and in the
Tympanida (Pls. 83, 94) with two horizontal rings, an upper mitral and a
lower basal. In the great majority of these #Stephoidea# there often
develop in definite places characteristic processes or apophyses, whose
branches combine to form a loose tissue or an incomplete lattice-shell.
This becomes complete in the #Cyrtellaria#, the majority of which retain
more or less {lxxxiii}distinct traces of the sagittal ring. Hence the
skeletons of all NASSELLARIA may be derived monophyletically (Hypothesis A,
p. 893) from a simple sagittal ring (_Archicircus_ and _Lithocircus_, Pl.
81). This theory, however, encounters the great difficulty that in many
#Stephoidea# (_Cortina_, _Cortiniscus_, &c.) it is combined in a remarkable
manner with the basal tripod of the #Plectoidea#, whilst in these latter it
is entirely wanting (compare p. 894).


125. _The Plectoid Skeleton._--Those forms are distinguished as Plectoid in
which three, four, or more radial siliceous spines proceed from a common
point, which lies excentrically outside the central capsule and at the
basal pole of its vertical allopolar main axis. This peculiar type of
skeletal formation only occurs in the legion NASSELLARIA, and is specially
characteristic of the order #Plectoidea# (p. 898, Pl. 91). But since the
essential elements of this remarkable skeleton also occur in many other
NASSELLARIA, sometimes combined with the Circoid, sometimes with the
Cyrtoid skeleton, it perhaps has a fundamental significance in this legion;
at all events it is possible to derive monophyletically all the other forms
of this legion from it (Hypothesis B, p. 893). The simplest form of the
Plectoid skeleton is a tripod, the three feet of which either lie in a
horizontal plane (_Triplagia_, Pl. 91, fig. 2), or correspond to the three
edges of a low pyramid (_Plagiacantha_). A fourth ray is sometimes added,
which stands vertically upon the summit of the pyramid (_Plagoniscus_,
_Plagiocarpa_, Pl. 91, figs. 4, 5). In other #Plectoidea# three secondary
rays are intercalated between the three primary (Hexaplagida, &c.); seldom
the number is greatly increased (Polyplagida, &c.). The rays are rarely
simple, but usually branched; in the Plagonida (Pl. 91, figs. 2-6) the
branches remain free; in the Plectanida (Pl. 91, figs. 7-13) they are
united to form a loose wicker-work. From such a web a perfect Cyrtoid shell
may arise. Several forms of Plagonida may also be readily confounded with
the isolated triradiate or quadriradiate spicula of many Beloid skeletons
(_Sphærozoum_, _Lampoxanthium_, &c.).


126. _The Spongoid Skeleton._--From the simple lattice-skeleton which the
majority of Radiolaria possess, some of them develop a spongy shell; the
trabeculæ of the lattice-work, situated in one plane in the former, are
developed in the latter in different planes and cross irregularly in all
directions; thus arises a kind of wicker-work of more or less spongy
structure, usually with very thin trabeculæ and irregular meshes. Such
Spongoid shells are most common among the SPUMELLARIA, especially in the
#Sphæroidea# (Spongosphærida, Pl. 18) and #Discoidea# (Spongodiscida, Pls.
41-47), more rarely in the #Prunoidea# and #Larcoidea#. Lattice-work of
similar spongy structure occurs very seldom among the NASSELLARIA, _e.g._,
in some #Plectoidea# (Pl. 91) and #Cyrtoidea# (_Spongocyrtis_,
_Spongopyramis_, _Spongomelissa_, &c., Pl. 56, fig. 10; Pl. 64, figs. 5-10,
&c.). Among the PHÆODARIA spongy skeletons are very rare; they {lxxxiv}are
to be seen in some #Phæosphæria# (_Oroplegma_, Pl. 107, fig. 1;
_Sagoplegma_, Pl. 108, fig. 2; _Auloplegma_, Pl. 111, fig. 8). No Spongoid
skeletons are known among the ACANTHARIA.


127. _The Cannoid Skeleton._--Cannoid or tubular skeletons are those which
are composed of hollow tubes; they occur exclusively in the PHÆODARIA or
CANNOPYLEA. Tubular processes, nevertheless, occur in some other
Radiolaria, as, for example, among the SPUMELLARIA in a portion of the
Collosphærida (_Siphonosphæra_, _Caminosphæra_, Pls. 6, 7), and of the
#Prunoidea# (_Pipetta_, _Cannartus_, &c., Pl. 39, figs. 6-10, &c.), also
among the NASSELLARIA in _Theosyringium_ (Pl. 68, figs. 4-6), _Cannobotrys_
(Pl. 96, figs. 3, 4, 8-11, 20-22), &c. In all these cases, however, the
tubes are direct processes of the cavity of the shell, the trabeculæ of the
lattice-work being solid. Only in the CANNOPYLEA are the lattice-bars
themselves, the radial spines and appendicular organs, generally tubular
(hence the designation "Pansolenia"). The lumen of the thin-walled
siliceous tubes is filled with jelly, and hence the specific gravity of the
relatively large skeleton is considerably diminished. This peculiarity is
not found in all CANNOPYLEA; it is wanting in all Sagosphærida and
Concharida, as well as in a part of the Orosphærida and Castanellida; in
the latter there are found intermediate stages between hollow and solid
skeletal rods. Very often a fine siliceous thread runs in the axis of the
tubes, which is connected with its wall by lateral branches (Pl. 110, figs.
4, 6; Pl. 115, figs. 6, 7). More seldom the tubes are divided by horizontal
septa into a series of chambers (Medusettida, Pls. 118-120). The two
families Aulosphærida (Pls. 109-111) and Cannosphærida (Pl. 112) are
distinguished from all other PHÆODARIA by the fact that their tubes are
separated by astral septa in the nodal points of the lattice-shell (§§ 112,
134).


128. _The Conchoid Skeleton._--By the name "Conchoid skeletons" are
distinguished the bivalved lattice-shells which occur exclusively in the
legion PHÆODARIA; they are quite characteristic of the #Phæoconchia# or
_Phæodaria bivalvia_, which embrace three families:--Concharida (Pls.
123-125), Coelodendrida (Pls. 121, 122), and Coelographida (Pls. 126-128).
The two valves of the lattice-shell of the Concharida are simple,
hemispherical, or boat-shaped, whilst in the Coelodendrida and
Coelographida tubes grow out from them, which branch and usually give rise
by anastomosis to a second external bivalved shell. In all #Phæoconchia#
the two valves are so disposed about the central capsule that an open slit
remains between them, into which open the apertures of the central capsule;
and since all these _Phæodaria conchoidea_ are TRIPYLEA, with three typical
openings in the central capsule, and since the two lateral accessory
openings lie at either side of the aboral pole, and the unpaired
main-opening at the oral pole of the main axis, it follows that the two
valves are to be regarded as dorsal and ventral as in the Brachiopoda (not
right and left as in the Lamellibranchiata). The dorsal and ventral
{lxxxv}valves are usually equal, but in a portion of the Concharida they
present constant differences. In this family the two valves are attached to
each other by their free edges, just as in the bivalved Mollusca and
Diatoms; and these edges may either be smooth (Conchasmida, Pl. 123, figs.
1-6), or dentate (Conchopsida, Pls. 124, 125); the valvular connection of
the latter is sometimes strengthened by a special ligament which unites the
two valves at the aboral pole (Pl. 123, figs. 8, 9). The form of the valve
is sometimes hemispherical, sometimes boat-shaped, with a sagittal keel.


129. _Medullary and Conical Shells._--In all Radiolaria whose skeleton
consists of a double shell or of two concentric lattice-shells united by
radial bars, an inner medullary shell (testa medullaris) and an outer
cortical shell (testa corticalis) may be distinguished (see note A, below).
The medullary shell is usually to be regarded as a primary, the cortical as
a secondary structure. Such double shells occur among the SPUMELLARIA in
the Dyosphærida (Pls. 19, 20), as well as in many #Prunoidea# (Pls. 39,
40), #Discoidea# (Pls. 33, 34), and #Larcoidea# (Pls. 9, 10); among the
ACANTHARIA only in the family Phractopeltida (Pl. 133); among the
NASSELLARIA only in very few #Cyrtoidea# (_e.g._, _Periarachnium_, Pl. 55,
fig. 11), and finally among the PHÆODARIA in the Cannosphærida (Pl. 112) as
well as in part of the Coelodendrida (Pl. 121) and Coelographida (Pls. 127,
128). In most cases (if not always?) the cortical shell arises by the
growth of radial spines from the surface of the medullary shell; these
become united at equal distances from the centre by transverse apophyses,
the surface of the secondary calymma furnishing the basis for their
secretion (§ 85). Nevertheless, it seems that in many #Sphærellaria# the
formation of the whole cortical shell proceeds simultaneously (at a
definite dictyotic period) like that of the primary medullary shell (see
note B). Whilst in the PHÆODARIA, ACANTHARIA, and NASSELLARIA, at most two
concentric shells are formed, in many SPUMELLARIA their number increases
continuously with additional growth; in many #Sphærellaria# it rises to
four, eight, or even more, as well as in many #Discoidea# (if the
concentric, peripherally disposed rings of chambers be regarded as
incomplete flattened shells). In these cases either only the innermost
primary lattice-shell is to be styled "medullary shell," or at most the two
innermost (inner and outer medullary shells), all the others being
cortical.

  A. The distinction between medullary and cortical shells was originally
  based in my Monograph (1862, p. 50) upon the topographical relation of
  the lattice-shells to the central capsule, inasmuch as I regarded all
  intracapsular shells as medullary, all extracapsular as cortical.
  Hertwig, however (1879, p. 122), rightly pointed out that this
  distinction is unpractical, "because the same lattice-shell in the same
  species may lie within or without the central capsule, according to the
  size of the latter." He proposes, therefore, to restrict the term
  medullary shell to the innermost, and to call all the others cortical; a
  course which seems justified by the special significance of the primary
  innermost lattice-shell ("as the point of origin of the radial spines").
  But in most #Sphærellaria# which form three or more concentric shells,
  the two innermost, which lie near together within the {lxxxvi}central
  capsule, are very different in size and dictyosis from all the others
  which lie outside, and are separated by wider interspaces (compare Pls.
  17, 24, 29-32, 40, &c.). In these cases it appears better to regard the
  two inner as inner and outer medullary shells, and all the others as
  cortical shells. The character of the dictyosis in the intracapsular and
  extracapsular shells is often so different that I have made it the basis
  of separation of _Thecosphæra_ and _Rhodosphæra_ among the Liosphærida
  (p. 60), of Elatommatida and Diplosphærida among the Astrosphærida (p.
  208), &c.

  B.--R. Hertwig (1879, L. N. 33, pp. 40, 123) separates the true
  (simultaneously formed) "cortical shells" (_e.g._, of _Actinomma_,
  _Cromyomma_) from the arachnoid "siliceous networks" (_e.g._, of
  _Diplosphæra_ and _Arachnosphæra_) which are formed by the successive
  union of tangential apophyses of the radial spines. Whether this
  principle is right in the theory or not, it cannot be carried out
  practically. Compare also Pl. 25, fig. 4.


130. _Dictyosis or Lattice Formation of the Skeleton._--In the great
majority of Radiolaria the dictyosis or formation of lattice-work, and
especially the formation of a variously-shaped "lattice-shell," plays such
an important part that the whole class has long been popularly known in
Germany by the name "lattice animalcules" ("Gitterthierchen" or
"Gitterlinge") (_Protista dictyota_). The old name Polycystina also (1838),
although referring only to the SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, is derived from
the lattice-work of the siliceous skeleton. The extremely various forms in
which this is manifested furnish the means of distinguishing species. The
specific conformation of the skeletal lattice-work is usually caused by the
special disposition of the sarcodictyum (§ 94), whose exoplasmatic threads
become silicified or (in the ACANTHARIA) converted into bars of acanthin.
In many cases, however, the form of the lattice is mainly dependent upon
the situation and form of the radial spines or of special processes from
them. With respect to their origin, two varieties of lattice may be
distinguished--simultaneous and successive. _Simultaneous dictyosis_ occurs
especially in the simple lattice-shells of the #Sphærellaria# and
PHÆODARIA, where, at a given moment ("dictyotic moment") the _whole_
lattice of the shell is excreted on the surface of the calymma. _Successive
dictyosis_, on the other hand, is found more particularly in the
lattice-shells of the ACANTHARIA (and in the concentric cortical shells of
many #Sphærellaria#), which develop from the separate lattice-plates formed
by the apophyses of the radial spines, and hence not at the same moment.
The lattice-shells of the #Cyrtellaria#, which gradually grow out from a
sagittal ring or a basal tripod, arise by successive dictyosis.


131. _Dictyosis of the Spumellaria._--Siliceous lattice-structures are
wanting in the first section of the SPUMELLARIA, the #Collodaria#, but in
the second section, #Sphærellaria#, they are developed in extraordinary
variety of details. In spite of this extreme richness in different forms,
the lattice-shells of the SPUMELLARIA may all be derived from one and the
same primitive ground-form, a simple lattice-sphere with regular hexagonal
meshes (_Phormosphæra_, p. 61, Pl. 12, figs. 9-11; _Heliosphæra_, &c.).
{lxxxvii}The siliceous bars which bound these regular and subregular meshes
are at first exceedingly then and filiform; afterwards they become thicker
or spread out laterally, whence the meshes often become round with a
hexagonal frame (Pl. 12, fig. 5; Pl. 28, fig. 1). If the latter vanish, a
lattice-shell with simple circular meshes is formed. Very commonly the
regular form of the meshes or pores becomes more or less irregular,
polygonal, or roundish. Hence, in general, four different principal forms
of dictyosis may be distinguished among the SPUMELLARIA; viz. (1) regular
or subregular _hexagonal_ meshes; (2) regular or subregular _circular_
meshes; (3) irregular _polygonal_ meshes; (4) irregular _roundish_ meshes.
The three latter forms are to be regarded as secondary, derived from the
primary first form. In those SPUMELLARIA which possess several concentric
lattice-shells enclosed one within another, either these have all the same
form of dictyosis, or the lattice-work of the innermost primary shell is
different from that of the outer secondary shells (Pls. 19, 20); sometimes
these latter also differ more or less among themselves (§ 129).


132. _Dictyosis of the Acantharia._--The lattice-structures of the
ACANTHARIA differ essentially from those of other Radiolaria in several
particulars. Firstly, they consist not of silica but of acanthin (§ 102);
secondly, they are always secondary formations, usually developed from
transverse processes of the primary centrogenous radial spines; thirdly,
their formation is not simultaneous (at the same time over the same shell),
but successive (proceeding from the individual radial spines tangentially
towards the middle of the intervals); fourthly, the configuration of the
network is due to the relative position of the spines and the mode of union
of their transverse apophyses. Since they are at right angles to the
spines, and since the branches of the apophyses are at right angles to
them, the original ground-form of their dictyosis is a lattice-work with
quadrangular meshes; these are often quite regular and square (Pl. 130,
figs. 5, 6; Pl. 136, figs. 2, 9, &c.); more commonly they are rectangular
or irregularly quadrangular (Pl. 131, fig. 10; Pl. 133, figs. 2, 3, &c.).
In the majority of the ACANTHARIA the quadrangular form of the meshes
passes over into an irregularly polygonal or roundish one (Pls. 137, 138).
Very often the primary meshes of the lattice-shells, which immediately
surround the radial spines, are larger and more regular ("aspinal pores"),
whilst the numerous secondary meshes between them are smaller and irregular
("coronal pores"; Pl. 135, figs. 1-4, &c.).


133. _Dictyosis of the Nassellaria._--The siliceous lattice-structures of
the NASSELLARIA are formed on the whole like those of the SPUMELLARIA, with
which they were formerly united under the name "Polycystina." In this group
also there may be distinguished as two main forms the regular and
irregular. In the NASSELLARIA the regular lattice-structures generally
exhibit hexagonal or circular meshes, whilst the irregular are either
polygonal or roundish; the irregular forms are, however, much more abundant
than the {lxxxviii}regular, and a further distinction from the SPUMELLARIA
consists in the fact that the primary skeletal elements, from which the
lattice is secondarily developed, exercise a predominant influence upon
their form. These primary elements in the majority of the NASSELLARIA are
to be seen in two morphologically most important structures:--first, the
_primary sagittal ring_, which embraces the central capsule in the median
plane (§ 124); and secondly, the _basal tripod_ (§ 125), whose three
diverging rays proceed from the base of the central capsule, whilst
commonly a fourth vertical ray supports the dorsal side of latter (compare
Pls. 81-91, p. 892). In the majority of the NASSELLARIA these two primary
elements appear in combination, whilst in others only one of them is
recognisable. In addition there occur numerous monaxon lattice-shells in
which neither of these elements can be recognised, but a simple ovoid
lattice-shell (cephalis) alone forms the whole skeleton or its primary part
(Pl. 51, fig. 13; Pl. 98, fig. 13). The great difficulty in the
morphological interpretation and phylogenetic derivation of the
NASSELLARIAN skeleton lies in the fact that each of these three
elements--the primary sagittal ring, the basal tripod, and the latticed
cephalis--may form the whole skeleton by itself or be combined with one or
both of the others (p. 893). Even nearly related or at all events very
similar forms may differ very greatly in this respect. With regard to the
manifold forms of their dictyosis it follows that it is partly dependent
upon one of the two first elements, partly independent. In the
#Plectellaria# (or those NASSELLARIA which do not possess a complete
lattice-shell) the lattice-work is usually irregular and arises by union of
the ramifications, which proceed either from the primary sagittal ring
(Pls. 81, 82, 92-94) or from the basal tripod (Pl. 91). In the
#Cyrtellaria# (or NASSELLARIA with a complete lattice-shell, Pls. 51-80),
on the other hand, the lattice-work is sometimes regular, sometimes
irregular, being often very different in the different joints of a
segmented shell (Pl. 72); a great part of it arises independently of the
two chief morphological elements, and develops according to laws similar to
those which regulate the dictyosis of the SPUMELLARIA.


134. _Dictyosis of the Phæodaria._--The lattice-structures of the
PHÆODARIA, which consist of a silicate of carbon (§ 102), are on the whole
not developed in such variety as those of the other Radiolaria, but exhibit
several essentially different types of structure, not reducible to a common
primitive type of lattice-work. In one portion of this legion there occurs
an ordinary simple lattice-work (as in SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA), with
solid trabeculæ; of these the Castanellida (Pl. 113) and Concharida (Pls.
123-125) have usually regular or subregular, circular meshes, sometimes
hexagonally framed; the Orosphærida (Pls. 106, 107) large irregular
polygonal meshes with thick trabeculæ, the Sagosphærida (Pl. 108) large
triangular meshes with thin filiform trabeculæ. The Challengerida (Pl. 99)
are characterised by a very delicate regular lattice-work, with minute
hexagonal pores, like a Diatomaceous frustule. The Medusettida (Pls.
118-120) {lxxxix}show a peculiar alveolar structure, numerous small
compartments being enclosed between two parallel plates. In the Circoporida
(Pls. 114-117) and Tuscarorida (Pl. 100) the opaque porcellanous shell has
a peculiar cement structure (§ 104), and the lattice-structure is confined
for the most part to characteristic rings of pores at the base of the
hollow tubes, which arise from the shell. The most peculiar lattice-work,
however, appears in the segmented shell of the Aulosphærida (Pls. 109-111)
and Cannosphærida (Pl. 112). In the former the large meshes of the
lattice-work are usually subregular and triangular, in the latter
polygonal; the trabeculæ are hollow cylinders, filled with jelly, and
containing usually a central axial thread. In each nodal point of the
lattice, in which three or more tangential tubes meet, these are separated
by stellate or astral septa.


135. _Radial Spines of the Skeleton._--The skeleton in the great majority
of Radiolaria is armed with radial spines, which are of great importance in
the development of their general form and of their vital functions. From a
morphological point of view the number, arrangement, and disposition of the
spines is usually the determining factor as regards the general form of the
skeleton. Physiologically they discharge distinct functions, as organs of
protection and support; they act also, like the tentacles of the lower
animals, as prehensile organs, since their points, lateral branches, barbed
hooks, &c. serve to hold fast nutritive materials. In general main-spines
and accessory spines may be distinguished in most Radiolaria; the former
are of pre-eminent importance in determining the figure of the skeleton;
the latter are merely appendicular organs. The main-spines present such
characteristic and important differences in the various legions of
Radiolaria that they must be considered separately.


136. _Radial Spines of the Spumellaria._--The radial spines, which exhibit
most manifold variations in the large order #Sphærellaria#, present
characteristic differences in its four suborders. In the #Sphæroidea# their
number and disposition serve for the separation into families (p. 59); the
Cubosphærida (Pls. 21-25) always possess six radial main-spines, which
stand opposite to each other in pairs and lie in three diameters of the
shell, which are at right angles to each other and correspond to the axes
of the regular crystallographic system. The Staurosphærida (Pl. 15) have
four spines, which form a regular cross and stand opposite to each other in
pairs, in two axes at right angles. The Stylosphærida (Pls. 13-17) show
only two main-spines, which are opposed to each other in the vertical main
axis of the body. Finally, the Astrosphærida (Pls. 18-20, 26-30) are
characterised by a larger and variable number of radial spines (eight,
twelve, twenty or more), sometimes regularly, sometimes irregularly
arranged. Among the other #Sphærellaria# the #Prunoidea# (Pls. 13-17, 39,
40) are most allied to the Stylosphærida with two opposite main-spines; the
#Discoidea# (Pls. 31-47), on the other hand, to the Staurosphærida with
four crossed spines; there exist, however, #Discoidea# with two opposite,
three marginal, or numerous radial main-spines; it is {xc}characteristic of
this suborder that they all usually lie in the horizontal median plane of
the lenticular shell, arising from its equatorial margin. The #Larcoidea#
(Pls. 9, 10, 49, 50) show a great variety in the number and arrangement of
their radial main-spines, which in the different families of this suborder
stand in direct causal relation to the various forms of growth of the
shell; usually the primary main-spines lie either in the three different
dimensive axes, at right angles to each other, whose differentiation is
characteristic of the lentelliptical Larcoid shell (§§ 34, 122) or in
definite diagonal axes, which cut the former obliquely. The radial spines
of the SPUMELLARIA are _never_ united in the centre of the body, but arise
separately from the surface of the primary central lattice-shell (medullary
shell), more rarely from one of the secondary (cortical) shells, which
enclose it. Their form is originally three-edged (sometimes pyramidal,
sometimes prismatic); the cause of this is to be found in their origin from
the nodal points of the lattice-shell, whose meshes are primitively
hexagonal; hence three trabeculæ unite in each nodal point, and are
produced into three edges of the spine. Very commonly, however, the spines
are round (conical or cylindrical), more rarely polygonal. The three edges
are often delicately toothed, not unfrequently spirally twisted around the
axis of the spine (Pl. 21, figs. 1, 12).


137. _Radial Spines of the Acantharia_.--The radial spines of this legion
have a much greater significance than in the other three classes of
Radiolaria, since here alone they are the primary determining factors in
the skeletal structure, and grow outwards from the middle of the central
capsule. This centrogenous origin of the radial spines is as characteristic
of the ACANTHARIA as their chemical constitution, which is not siliceous
but acanthinic (§ 102). Furthermore, their form is in most cases so
peculiar that even an isolated ACANTHARIAN spine can be generally
distinguished from one belonging to either of the other three legions. In
the great majority of the ACANTHARIA (all #Acanthonida# and
#Acanthophracta#) twenty radial spines are constantly present, which,
disposed according to a definite geometrical law, make up the skeleton
(compare § 110 above and p. 717). The twenty spines are generally simply
apposed to each other in the centre (either by the surfaces or the edges of
their pyramidal base); more rarely they are completely united and form a
single star-like piece of acanthin (_Astrolithium_). Very rarely
(_Acanthochiasma_) each two opposite spines are united so that ten
diametric bars cross in the middle of the central capsule. Whilst in the
great majority of ACANTHARIA these twenty radial spines are present, the
small group #Actinelida# is characterised by the possession of an
inconstant, often very large number, sometimes over one hundred. Among
these #Actinelida# are probably to be found the stem-forms of the whole
legion. The variously modified spines of the ACANTHARIA may be grouped in
three main categories: (1) round (cylindrical or conical); (2) four-edged
(prismatic or pyramidal); (3) two-edged (leaf- or sword-shaped). The latter
very commonly bear two {xci}opposite transverse processes, the former four
crossed ones. By ramification and union of these apophyses arise the
lattice-shells of the #Acanthophracta# (excepting the Sphærocapsida).


138. _Radial Spines of the Nassellaria._--The radial spines in this legion
show as great a variety in their form as in the SPUMELLARIA, and, as in
them, are solid, siliceous bars, usually three-edged (prismatic or
pyramidal), or round (cylindrical or conical); more seldom they are
polygonal in section. The great majority of the NASSELLARIA are, however,
distinguished by a triradial structure, three primary radial bars diverging
from the base of the central capsule (usually from the centre of the
porochora); there is usually in addition a fourth apical spine, which
passes upwards vertically or obliquely on the dorsal aspect of the central
capsule. These three or four typical radial spines of the NASSELLARIA may
be derived with great probability from the basal tripod of the #Plectoidea#
(_Plagoniscus_, _Plectaniscus_, &c., Pl. 91); and since this tripod is very
characteristically combined in _Cortina_ and _Cortiniscus_ with the primary
sagittal ring of the #Stephoidea#, the three typical rays may be generally
designated "cortinar feet," in contradistinction to the other radial
processes of the NASSELLARIAN skeleton.  One of the three descending basal
feet ("pes caudalis," Pls. 91-95, C) is always unpaired, and lies in the
vertical median plane (or sagittal plane), just as does the vertically
directed apical spine, which originally forms the dorsal bar of the
sagittal ring, and is produced upwards into the "apical horn," (marked _a_
on the plates). The other two basal feet are paired, and diverge right and
left, forwards and downwards ("pedes pectorales," _p.p._). Six-rayed
NASSELLARIA, in which three secondary (interradial) feet are intercalated
between the three primary (perradial) cortinar feet, are less common than
the three-rayed forms. In some groups the number rises still higher, nine,
twelve, or even more secondary feet being intercalated between the three
primary. Besides, accessory radial spines may be developed on different
parts of the shell, which have sometimes a definite relationship to the
typical radial spines, sometimes not. Their form and ramification are very
various (Pls. 51-98).


139. _Radial Spines of the Phæodaria._--The radial spines of the PHÆODARIA
are very clearly distinguished from those of other Radiolaria by the fact
that they are usually hollow tubes, rarely solid bars. As a rule, the tubes
are cylindrical, often slightly fusiform or conical, their siliceous wall
is very thin, and their lumen filled with jelly; a fine thread of silica
usually runs in the axis, and in several families is connected by fine
transverse threads with the wall of the tube (Pl. 110, figs. 4, 6; Pl. 115,
figs. 6, 7). The peculiar family Medusettida is characterised by a very
remarkable segmentation of the hollow spines (Pls. 118-120). Each tube is
divided by a series of septa into chambers, which communicate by a central
or excentric opening in each septum, an arrangement resembling the
siphuncle of the chambered Cephalopod shells. The number and
{xcii}arrangement of the radial tubes in most PHÆODARIA is indefinite and
very variable; only in a few families is the number constant in each
species and genus, and the disposition regular. The Medusettida (Pls.
118-120) resemble the NASSELLARIA, inasmuch as equal radial feet diverge
from the base of their shell, sometimes three in number (_Cortinetta_, Pl.
117, fig. 9), sometimes four (_Medusetta_, Pl. 120, figs. 1-4), sometimes
six (_Gazelletta_); _Gorgonetta_ is specially distinguished by the
possession of six ascending and six descending spines regularly alternating
(Pl. 119). The Tuscarorida (Pl. 100) usually have three or four equidistant
feet. The Circoporida (Pls. 115-117), on the other hand, rather approach
the #Sphæroidea#, their spherical or regular polyhedral shell having a
definite number of tubular radial spines, which arise at regular intervals
from their angles; _Circoporus_ has six, _Circospathis_ nine, _Circogonia_
twelve, and _Circorrhegma_ twenty radial tubes. Very rarely the tubes of
the PHÆODARIA are angular, usually they are round, more or less
cylindrical, though they are often bifurcated or even ramified, and exhibit
a great wealth of the most delicate appendages; siliceous hairs, bristles,
spines, barbed or anchor-like hooks, spathillæ, brushes, circlets, &c.
(compare Pls. 99-128).


140. _Main-Spines and Accessory Spines._--As accessory spines (Paracanthæ)
we oppose to the main-spines (Protacanthæ), just described, all those
processes which have no determining influence upon the formation of the
skeleton as a whole, but are to be regarded as secondary constituents of
the skeleton, or appendicular organs of inferior significance. They are
developed in the utmost variety, sometimes as hairs or bristles, sometimes
as thorns or clubs, either straight or curved (often zigzag), smooth or
barbed; sometimes standing vertically upon the shell, or directed towards
the centre, sometimes obliquely, or rising at a definite angle. In those
SPUMELLARIA whose lattice-shell consists of several concentric spheres, the
accessory spines generally arise from the outermost, the main-spines, on
the contrary, from the innermost. In the NASSELLARIA, multifarious forms of
accessory spines are especially developed in the order #Plectellaria#. In
the PHÆODARIA they are often furnished with delicate appendages, _e.g._,
anchor-hooks, spathillæ, coronets, &c. Among the ACANTHARIA the accessory
spines which arise from the surface of the shell in the #Acanthophracta#
are very characteristic. They are not radially disposed (like the similar
superficial spines of the SPUMELLARIA), but parallel to the radial
main-spines from whose transverse processes they arise. Since in all these
#Acanthophracta# the twenty radial main-spines are opposite to each other
in pairs, all the accessory spines (often several hundred) are parallel to
ten different regularly disposed axes of the lattice-shell (Pls. 134-138).

  The skeletons of the Radiolaria, in addition to the general relations
  which have been discussed above, present numerous and important special
  differences in the various larger and smaller groups. These are indicated
  in detail in the descriptions of the legions, orders, and families in the
  systematic portion of this Report.

A SKETCH OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RADIOLARIA IN THE YEAR
1884.


----


CHAPTER V.--ONTOGENY OR INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT.

(§§ 141-152.)

141. _Individual Developmental Stages._--The germinal history of the
Radiolaria presents great obstacles to direct observation, and hence is
very incompletely known. The fragmentary observations, however (having been
made on Radiolaria of very various groups and supplemented by comparative
anatomical considerations), allow us to draw a general picture of the
essential developmental processes in this great class. It may probably be
assumed that in all Radiolaria, after maturation, the central capsule
discharges the function of a sporangium, and its contents are broken up
into numerous flagellate swarm-spores (zoospores). After these flagellate
swarm-spores (resembling _Astasia_) have emerged from the ruptured central
capsule, they probably pass over into a _Heliozoan_-stage (_Actinophrys_)
and then after the formation of a jelly-veil into the condition of
_Sphærastrum_. Afterwards, when a membrane is formed between the outer
jelly-veil and the inner nucleated cell-body, an _Actissa_-stage arises,
which exhibits in its simplest form the differentiation of the spherical
unicellular body into the central capsule and calymma. _Actissa_ thus
represents both ontogenetically and phylogenetically the primitive
condition of the Radiolarian organism, and may thus be regarded as the
point of departure of all other forms.


142. _The Astasia-Stage._--The formation of flagellate zoospores in the
mature central capsule is probably to be regarded as the common form of
individual development in all Radiolaria; since the whole contents are
utilised in the formation of these swarm-spores, and since the
extracapsulum takes no share in the process and perishes after they are
evacuated, the _central capsule_ may be regarded as a _sporangium_ (see
note A, below). The zoospores of the Radiolaria generally arise in the
following way:--the nucleus of the unicellular organism, sometimes early,
sometimes late (and in several different ways, §§ 63-70) breaks up into
numerous small nuclei, and each of these surrounds itself with a small
portion of the endoplasm. Very often, perhaps generally, this endoplasm
contains one or several fat-granules and sometimes also a small oblong
crystal; from the protoplasm {xciv}of the small roundish or ovoid cells
protrudes one or more vibratile flagella. The fully developed spores, which
commence their vibrations even within the central capsule, emerge when it
ruptures, and swim about freely in the surrounding water by means of the
flagellum. At this stage of its existence the young Radiolarian represents
essentially the simplest form of the Flagellata, such as _Astasia_ or
_Euglena_; the unicellular body is for the most part ovoid or
subcylindrical, sometimes fusiform or reniform, usually from 0.004 to 0.008
mm. in diameter (Pl. 1, fig. 1_c_; Pl. 129, fig. 11). In the anterior part
of the flagellate cell, immediately behind the base of the flagellum, lies
a homogeneous, spherical nucleus, whilst in the posterior part are usually
several small fat-granules and often also a small oblong crystal (hence the
name "crystal-spore," "Krystall-Schwärmer"). The number of vibrating
flagella, which are extremely long and fine, seems to be variable, usually
one, sometimes two, occasionally perhaps three, or even four or more (see
note B).

  A. The formation of the motile spores in the central capsule was first
  observed by J. Müller in _Acanthometra_ (1856, L. N. 10, p. 502), then by
  A. Schneider in _Thalassicolla_ (1858, L. N. 13, p. 41), and finally by
  myself in _Sphærozoum_ (1859, L. N. 16, p. 141). These older observations
  were, however, incomplete, for the origin of the motile corpuscles from
  the contents of the central capsule was not observed. The first complete
  and detailed observations upon the formation of spores in the Radiolaria
  were published in 1871 by Cienkowski (L. N. 22, p. 372, Taf. xxix.); they
  relate to two different Polycyttaria, _Collosphæra_ and _Collozoum_.
  These investigations were supplemented by R. Hertwig on _Collozoum_ and
  _Thalassicolla_ (1876, L. N. 26, pp. 28, 43, &c.); on _Collozoum_ he made
  the important discovery that the Polycyttaria form two kinds of spores,
  one with and the other without crystals, and that the latter are divided
  into macrospores and microspores (compare the chapter on "Reproduction,"
  §§ 212-216). Quite recently Karl Brandt has confirmed these observations,
  and has extended them to all the genera of Polycyttaria (1881, L. N. 38,
  p. 393, and 1885, _loc. cit._).

  B. The number of flagella, projecting from each spore, is very difficult
  to determine, owing to their extraordinary length and slenderness. It
  appeared to me that in the majority of those Radiolaria whose spores I
  investigated only a single flagellum could be demonstrated with
  certainty, although sometimes two, springing from a common base, seemed
  to be present. Compare the chapter on "Reproduction," (§ 215) and the
  recent work of Karl Brandt on Sphærozoea (1885, L. N. 52, pp. 145-174).


143. _The Actinophrys-Stage._--The fate of the flagellate zoospores which
emerge from the mature central capsule of the Radiolaria has not hitherto
been decided by actual observation; all attempts to rear the swarming
zoospores have been in vain, for they have soon died. From what we know,
however, of the comparative morphology of the Protista, the hypothesis is
fully justified, that between the _Astasia_-stage of the flagellate
swarm-spores, and the well-known _Actissa_-stage of the simplest
Radiolaria, there lies an intermediate developmental stage, which may be
regarded as being essentially the simplest Heliozoan form, _Actinophrys_ or
_Heterophrys_. The swarm-spore is very probably converted directly in to a
simple floating _Heliozoon_ by its elongated or ovoid body {xcv}becoming
spherical and by fine pseudopodia protruding all round instead of a single
flagellum; the nucleus at the same time assuming a central position.


144. _The Sphærastrum-Stage._--The _Actinophrys_-stage of the young
Radiolaria, which proceeds immediately from the flagellate zoospore, is
probably connected with the _Actissa_-stage by an intermediate form, which
may be regarded as a simple skeletonless _Heliozoon_ with a jelly-veil; a
well-known example of such a form is _Sphærastrum_ (in the solitary, not
the social condition) and _Heterophrys_. This important intermediate form
has arisen from the simple _Actinophrys_-stage by the excretion of an
external structureless jelly-veil, such as is formed in many other Protista
(_e.g._, in the encystation of many Infusoria). The young Radiolarian in
this second _Heliozoon_-stage becomes a simple cell with pseudopodia
radiating on all sides; its body consists of three concentric spheres, the
central nucleus, the protoplasmic body proper, and the surrounding calymma
or jelly-veil. When a firm membrane is developed between the last two
spheres this _Sphærastrum_-stage passes over into the _Actissa_.

  The gap in our empirical knowledge which still exists between the
  flagellate stage (§ 142) and the simplest Radiolarian stage (_Actissa_, §
  145), can be filled hypothetically only by the assumption of several
  _Heliozoon_-stages following one upon another. It is possible also that
  the capsule-membrane is not formed between the endoplasm and exoplasm (as
  here supposed), but that the membrane was formed first outside the cell
  and the extracapsulum subsequently secreted around it.


145. _The Actissa-Stage._--The first SPUMELLARIAN genus, _Actissa_, is not
only the simplest form actually observed among the Radiolaria, and the true
prototype of the whole class, but also the simplest form under which the
Radiolarian organisation can be conceived. It is therefore extremely
probably that _Actissa_ not only forms the common stem-form of the whole
class in a phylogenetic sense, but is also its common ontogenetic or
germinal form. Probably in all Radiolaria the _Sphærastrum_-stage develops
immediately into the typical _Actissa_-stage, by the formation of a firm
membrane between the protoplasmic body of the spherical Heliozoan cell and
its jelly-veil. Thus arises the characteristic central capsule, which is
wanting in the nearly related Heliozoa. It is further probable that all
Radiolaria in their early stage will so far conform to the state of things
in _Actissa_ as to have the capsule-membrane of the spherical skeletonless
cell perforated everywhere by fine pores. This structure is retained in all
SPUMELLARIA, whilst in the other three legions those structural relations
of the capsule which are characteristic of each develop from the
_Actissa_-stage.


146. _The Ontogeny of the Spumellaria._--In the simplest case the
individual development in the SPUMELLARIA ceases with the _Actissa_-stage.
In all other genera of this legion diverging forms proceed from this, of
which the different growth of the three dimensive {xcvi}axes on the one
hand (§§ 44, 45), and the differentiation of the various parts of the
unicellular organism with the formation of the skeleton on the other, are
of pre-eminent significance. Even in the varying growth of the central
capsule in the different dimensions of space in the skeletonless
#Colloidea#, four different modes may be distinguished, which further, in
the corresponding development of the skeleton, furnish the basis for the
origin of the four orders of #Sphærellaria#. The most primitive and
simplest form of growth, equal extension in all directions, is found in the
spherical central capsule and the concentric spherical skeletons
(_Procyttarium_, #Sphæroidea#). When the growth of the central capsule
proceeds more rapidly in the direction of the vertical main axis than in
any other direction, the ellipsoidal or cylindrical central capsule
(_Actiprunum_) arises, and the vertically elongated skeleton of the
#Prunoidea#, which is derived from it. When, on the contrary, the growth of
the central capsule and lattice-shell is less in the direction of the
vertical main axis than in any other direction, the lenticular or discoid
central capsule (_Actidiscus_) arises, and the corresponding lenticular
shell of the #Discoidea#. Finally, even quite early in many SPUMELLARIA,
the growth of the central capsule and of the corresponding lattice-shell in
the three dimensive axes is different, and hence arise the lentelliptical
forms whose geometrical type is the triaxial ellipsoid or the rhombic
octahedron (_Actilarcus_, #Larcoidea#). Thus the origin of the four orders
of #Sphærellaria# is simply explained by a varying growth in the different
dimensive axes. The _primary_ (innermost) lattice-shell is in this legion
always _simultaneously_ developed (suddenly excreted at the moment of
lorication from the sarcodictyum). The _secondary_ lattice-shells, on the
other hand, which surround the former concentrically, and are united with
it by radial bars, arise _successively_ from within outwards.


147. _The Ontogeny of the Acantharia._--The individual development of the
ACANTHARIA in the simplest case (_Actinelius_) stops at a point which
differs from the _Actissa_-stage only in the change of radial axial threads
into acanthin spines. In the small group #Actinelida#, their number remains
variable and usually indeterminate (Adelacantha), whilst in the great
majority of the legion (#Acanthonida# and #Acanthophracta#) the number is
constantly twenty, and those spines are regularly arranged according to the
Müllerian law in five parallel circles, each containing four crossed spines
(Icosacantha). The simplest form among these latter is _Acanthometron_,
which may be regarded both ontogenetically and phylogenetically as the
common starting-point of all the Icosacantha. Within this extensive group
variations in the length of the dimensive axes appear, similar to those
observed in the SPUMELLARIA. In the Astrolonchida and #Sphærophracta# the
central capsule remains spherical, extending equally in all directions; and
correspondingly the lattice-shell, which is excreted on the surface of the
spherical calymma, remains spherical. In the Belonaspida (just as in the
#Prunoidea#) {xcvii}this form passes over into an ellipsoid by prolongation
of one axis; on the contrary, in the Hexalaspida (as in the #Discoidea#)
the discoidal or lenticular form arises by shortening of an axis. Finally,
in the Diploconida, and in some Hexalaspida in which the growth is
different in all three dimensive axes (as in the #Larcoidea#), both the
central capsule and the shell assume the lentelliptical form. The
lattice-shell of the #Acanthophracta# is usually successive in its
development, since from each of the twenty radial spines two or four
tangential apophyses proceed, whose branches subsequently unite and combine
to form the lattice-shell. Only in the peculiar Sphærocapsida can the
pavement-like shell arise simultaneously or in a moment of lorication.


148. _The Ontogeny of the Nassellaria._--The individual development of the
NASSELLARIA in the simplest instance remains stationary at the skeletonless
Nasselid stage (_Cystidium_, _Nassella_), which can be immediately derived
from the foregoing _Actissa_-stage by the disappearance of the pores in the
upper (apical) hemisphere of the central capsule, whilst in the lower
(basal) portion they are modified to form a porochora; the podoconus is
developed within the endoplasm upon this latter. Usually the spherical form
of the central capsule passes over into an ovoid or ellipsoidal one, the
vertical axis which passes through the centre of the porochora being
elongated. From the skeletonless Nassellida the other NASSELLARIA may be
derived both ontogenetically and phylogenetically by the excretion of an
extracapsular siliceous skeleton. Unfortunately, the earliest stages in the
formation of this skeleton are unknown, and hence no answer can at present
be given to the important question, in what order the three primary
skeletal elements of the NASSELLARIA (the basal tripod, sagittal ring, and
latticed cephalis) appear (compare §§ 111 and 182). If, for example, in
_Cortina_ and _Tripospyris_ the basal tripod were to appear first in the
ontogeny, and the sagittal ring were developed from this, then the
#Plectoidea# would be rightly considered to be the oldest forms in the
phylogeny of the skeleton-forming NASSELLARIA; and in the contrary case the
#Stephoidea# would be so regarded. The relations of growth in the three
dimensive axes are very variable in the NASSELLARIA; the three most
important factors in this respect (partly separately and partly in
combination) are; (1) the development of the basal tripod to a triradial
stauraxon form (the ground-form being a three-sided pyramid); (2) the
development of the sagittal ring in the median plane of the body (the
vertical axis having the poles different); (3) the development of the
latticed cephalis outside the central capsule (the poles of the vertical
axis being again different). Since the development both of the skeleton and
of the malacoma is characterised in most NASSELLARIA by the stronger growth
of the vertical axis and the differentiation of the two poles, the
allopolar monaxon ground-form acquires a predominant significance in this
legion (§ 32); the starting point of most of the further modifications is
the basal pole of the vertical main axis. Next to this the sagittal axis is
usually the most important determining factor (its dorsal and ventral poles
being {xcviii}usually different), more rarely the frontal axis (with equal
right and left poles). In the zygothalamous #Spyroidea# (as in the
#Stephoidea#) the formation of the shell proceeds from the sagittal ring,
whilst in the polythalamous #Cyrtoidea# the latticed cephalis is always the
starting point, from which a series of joints (thorax, abdomen, and in the
Stichocyrtida, the numerous post-abdominal joints) successively arise
(unipolar growth).


149. _The Ontogeny of the Phæodaria._--The individual development of the
PHÆODARIA in the simplest case stops with the skeletonless condition of the
Phæodinida (_Phæodina_, _Phæocolla_), which can be immediately derived from
the foregoing _Actissa_-stage by the disappearance of the pores in the
greater part of the central capsule, the characteristic astropyle being
developed at the basal pole (§ 60). Since this particular form and
structure of the spheroidal central capsule remains the same in all
PHÆODARIA, whilst the formation of their skeleton follows very different
directions, it follows that further common paths of development are
excluded both ontogenetically and phylogenetically. What will be laid down
in this respect as regards the phylogeny of the different groups of
PHÆODARIA (§§ 194-199) holds true also of their ontogeny. The relations of
growth in the three dimensive axes are hence very different in the
skeletons of the various groups of PHÆODARIA. This difference is best
marked in the #Phæoconchia#, whose bivalved lattice-shells have as their
ground-form the rhomboid pyramid of Ctenophora. In most #Phæogromia# the
monaxon lattice-shell may develop simultaneously by sudden excretion at a
particular moment of lorication; this is also the case with the polyaxon
lattice-shells of the #Phæosphæria#. In their future growth the development
of basal or radial apophyses is of special importance. In the majority of
the PHÆODARIA these apophyses are tubes of silicate filled with jelly
(often provided with an axial siliceous thread); thus their development is
distinguished by complications which are absent in the case of the other
three legions.


150. _Growth._--The growth of the body in the Radiolaria, as in all other
organisms, is the fundamental function of individual development (see note
A). All structural relations which this richest class of the Protista
exhibits may be referred to different forms of growth, either of the
unicellular malacoma or of the skeleton which it produces. In general the
special development of the skeleton is dependent upon that of the central
capsule, and of the sarcodictyum on the surface of the calymma; in the
further growth, however, the conditions are reversed, and the condition of
the skeleton already formed directly determines the further development of
the central capsule and of the calymma with its sarcodictyum. The four
legions of Radiolaria show, speaking generally, certain characteristic
differences in growth, which are due in great part to the different
structure and ground-form of their central capsule. In the two legions of
the Porulosa (SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA), in which the central capsule is
originally spherical and {xcix}the ground-form of the skeleton either
polyaxon or isopolar monaxon, two fundamental and variously combined
directions of growth are recognisable; firstly, the _concentric_ growth
(equal increase of volume in all directions), and secondly, multipolar or
_diametral_ growth (hypertrophy of certain parts in the direction of
definite pairs of radii). A different state of things obtains, however, for
the most part, in the two legions of the Osculosa (NASSELLARIA and
PHÆODARIA), in which the central capsule possesses a vertical main axis
with different poles, and the structure of the skeleton is determined by
this allopolar monaxon ground-form. The two fundamental directions of
growth here combined in the most various ways are, firstly, _unipolar_
growth (starting from the basal pole of the vertical main axis), and
secondly, radial or _pyramidal_ growth (characterised by the different
development of separate parts in the direction of definite radii). Whilst
the growth of the _malacoma_ is dependent on intussusception (as in most
organic structures capable of imbibing), the growth of the _skeleton_ in
all Radiolaria takes place by apposition (see note B).

  A. The earliest investigations into the modes of growth in the Radiolaria
  are due to J. Müller (L. N. 12, pp. 21-33). More detailed communications
  I gave myself in my Monograph (L. N. 16, pp. 150-159). The relations
  there sketched have now, in consequence of the examination of the
  Challenger collection, undergone many important additions, and in some
  divisions, important modifications; these are for the most part treated
  of in the general account of the separate families.

  B. The view here maintained, that the skeleton of all Radiolaria grows
  only by apposition, appeared formerly to have certain exceptions. I
  thought I had shown that in _Coelodendrum_ the thin-walled tubes grew not
  only in length but also in thickness, with continuous increase in the
  lumen (L. N. 16, pp. 152, 360). Further K. Brandt concluded, from the
  varying size of the median bars in the twin-spicules of _Sphærozoum_,
  that these siliceous structures grow by intussusception (L. N. 38, p.
  401). Both suppositions have been proved erroneous and I have come to the
  opinion that in all Radiolaria the skeleton grows by apposition.


151. _Regeneration._--Whilst the general course of individual development
(perhaps without any exception in the Radiolaria), begins with the
formation of zoospores in the central capsule, there yet occurs in some
groups a different form of ontogeny, introduced by simple division of the
unicellular organism, and coming under the term "regeneration" in its wider
sense. This spontaneous division occurs quite commonly in the Polycyttaria
(or social SPUMELLARIA), and produces their colonies (compare the chapter
on Reproduction, § 213). On the contrary, it has not been observed in the
solitary SPUMELLARIA, nor in the ACANTHARIA and NASSELLARIA; possibly,
however, the peculiar ACANTHARIAN family, Litholophida, has arisen by the
division of Acanthonida (compare p. 734). Among the PHÆODARIA division is
commonly observed in the order #Phæocystina# (which have an incomplete
Beloid skeleton or none), and also in the #Phæoconchia#. In all these cases
the increase by division is nothing else than an ordinary case of
cell-division, in which bisection of the nucleus precedes that of the
central capsule. The regeneration by {c}which each of the two
daughter-cells develops to a complete mother-cell depends upon simple
growth. Another form of regeneration, different from this, has been
observed in _Thalassicolla_. If the central capsule be extracted
artificially from the large concentric calymma, the enucleated central
capsule produces a new extracapsulum, with sarcomatrix, pseudopodia, and
calymma. This experiment may be repeated several times with the same
result. (Compare A. Schneider, 1867, L. N. 20.)


152. _The Formation of Colonies._--The individual development of colonies
takes place in all three families of the Polycyttaria (Collozoida,
Sphærozoida, Collosphærida) in the same simple way, by the repeated
division of a single monozootic SPUMELLARIAN. Since these divisions only
affect the central capsule and not the extracapsulum, the sister-cells,
which arise by repeated division of the mother, remain enclosed in a common
rapidly growing calymma. Probably in all Polycyttaria the commencement of
the formation of colonies immediately follows the _Actissa_-stage of the
monozootic mother-cell (or takes place in the _Thalassicolla_-stage, which
arises from the former by the development of alveoles in the calymma). The
simple central nucleus separates (by direct nuclear division) into two
halves, and the central capsule follows this process of bisection, becoming
constricted in the middle between the two daughter nuclei (Pl. 3, fig. 12).
In the further growth of the colony the process of division proceeds in the
older, now multinucleate, central capsules, in which an oil-globule has
taken the place of the original nucleus; then the division of the
oil-globules precedes that of the central capsule (Pl. 5, fig. 1). Another
mode of growth of the colonies is the multiplication of the central
capsules by gemmulation, or the formation of the so-called "extracapsular
bodies" (Gemmulæ, § 214). The characteristic skeletal structure of the
different species appears at a later stage. Whether ripe central capsules
can emerge from the social bond of a coenobium, and, having become
isolated, establish the formation of a new colony, is very doubtful. The
various forms which the coenobium assumes in the different species of
Polycyttaria, are due partly to simple growth, partly to the development of
large vacuoles in the calymma.

  The _form and size_ of the coenobia appear in many fully developed
  Polycyttaria to exhibit specific differences, which require further
  investigation; in the young stage, on the contrary, they are simple
  spheres or ellipsoids, often cylindrical or sausage-shaped (Pl. 3, figs.
  1, 4, 6, 11).  In some species the cylindrical gelatinous bodies become
  moniliform, and separated by transverse constrictions into many segments,
  each of which encloses a large alveole (Pl. 3, fig. 10). The rare
  ring-shape (Pl. 4, fig. 1) which I figured in 1862 in the case of
  _Collozoum_ (L. N. 16, p. 522, Taf. xxxv. fig. 1), I have recently
  observed in different species of Polycyttaria; it is capable of a very
  simple mechanical explanation, both ends of a sausage-shaped colony
  having been accidentally brought into contact by a wave and having united
  by agglutination. Quite recently Brandt has given a very complete account
  of the development, form, and growth of Polycyttarian colonies in his
  work on the colonial Radiolaria of the Bay of Naples (1885, L. N. 52, pp.
  71-85).



{ci}CHAPTER VI.--PHYLOGENY OR GENEALOGICAL DEVELOPMENT.

(§§ 153-200.)

153. _Sources of Phylogenetic Knowledge._--For the purpose of constructing
a hypothetical genealogical tree of the Radiolaria, as of all other
organisms, three sources of information are open to us, viz., palæontology,
comparative ontogeny, and comparative anatomy. In the present case,
however, these three sources are of very different value; the first two are
at present only very inadequately known and have only been partially
investigated, hence they can only be utilised to a very slight extent. The
comparative anatomy of the Radiolaria, on the other hand, is so completely
known, and affords such certain glimpses into the morphological relations
of the related groups, that by its aid we are in a position at all events
to lay down the general features of their phylogeny with some probability,
and to lay the foundation of a natural system.


154. _Natural and Artificial Systems._--Although in the classification of
the Radiolaria, as in the case of all other organisms, the natural system
must be regarded as the goal of systematic classification, our phylogenetic
knowledge of the Radiolaria is too fragmentary and inadequate to admit of
the systematic arrangement here adopted being regarded as a thoroughly
consistent natural system, that is, as representing the true genealogical
tree of the class. Owing, however, to the extraordinary variety of form of
the Radiolaria, and the complicated relationships of the larger and smaller
groups, a synoptical grouping of the different categories and the erection
of a complete, even if to some extent artificial, system, becomes a logical
necessity. Under these circumstances, and regard being had to both these
conditions, the following systematic treatment of the Radiolaria will
appear as a _compromise between the natural and artificial systems_, like
all other zoological and botanical classificatory attempts. On the one
hand, the attempt is made to arrange the larger and smaller groups as
nearly as possible according to their phylogenetic relationships, whilst,
on the other hand, the practice of circumscribing each by a definition as
clear and logical as possible has been carried out. Since these two efforts
naturally often come into contact, the insufficiency of many parts of the
arrangement is obvious, hence its hypothetical and provisional character is
emphatically stated.


155. _Systematic Categories._--The categories or different orders of
divisions have in the Radiolaria, as in all other organisms, no _absolute_
significance, but only a _relative_ value. In itself it is quite
unimportant whether the whole group be regarded, as at first, as a _family_
(Ehrenberg, 1847), or as an _order_ (J. Müller, 1858), or as a _class_
(Haeckel, {cii}1881). These different views are regulated, on the one hand,
by the known extent of the group and by the amount of our acquaintance with
it, and on the other, by comparison with related groups and by reference to
their conventional disposition. When, therefore, the whole class,
Radiolaria, is here divided into two subclasses, four legions, eight
orders, eighty-five families, &c., these artificial categories are drawn up
only in the conviction that by this means the easiest survey and most
thorough insight into the system as a whole may be attained; this latter
will indeed approach as far as possible the ideal of a natural system, but
must on numerous practical grounds always remain more or less artificial.
Since it is to be expected that with the progress of our systematic
knowledge the rank of the various categories will rise, it is possible that
in the future the arrangement of the group may be somewhat as
follows:--_Phylum_, RADIOLARIA; _Four Classes_, SPUMELLARIA, NASSELLARIA,
ACANTHARIA, PHÆODARIA; _Eight Legions_ (Nos. I.-VIII. in the following
Table); _Twenty Orders_ (Nos. 1-20 in the Table), &c.

156. _Formation of Species._--The totality of similar forms, which we unite
in one species, and which in the earlier dogmatic systems was regarded as a
category of absolute value, possesses only a _relative value_ like all
other systematic categories (§ 155). According to the individual views of
the systematist and the general survey which he has attained of the smaller
and larger systematic groups, the conception of a species adopted in his
practical work will be wider or narrower. In the present systematic
arrangement a medium extent has been adopted. It is shown that in the
Radiolaria, as in all other extensive groups of organisms, the constancy of
the species is very variable in the different groups. Many families of
Radiolaria are very rich in "bad species," _i.e._, very _variable_ forms,
in which the process of the formation of species is seen in progress; such,
for example, are--among the SPUMELLARIA, the Sphærozoida, Stylosphærida,
Phacodiscida and Pylonida; among the ACANTHARIA, the Amphilonchida and
Phractopeltida; among the NASSELLARIA, the #Stephoidea# and #Botryodea#;
and among the PHÆODARIA, the Aulacanthida, Sagosphærida, Castanellida and
Concharida. On the {civ}other hand, in some families numerous "good
species" may be distinguished, since the intermediate connecting forms are
no longer present and the forms have become _relatively constant_. As
instances of such families may be mentioned, among the SPUMELLARIA, the
Astrosphærida, Cyphinida, Porodiscida and Tholonida; among the ACANTHARIA
the Quadrilonchida and Dorataspida; among the NASSELLARIA, the #Spyroidea#
and #Cyrtoidea#; among the PHÆODARIA, the Challengerida, Medusettida,
Circoporida and Coelographida. The more carefully the different groups are
studied, the more numerous the individuals of each species under
comparison, the greater becomes the number of "bad" species among the
Radiolaria, and the smaller the number of good ones. Originally, no doubt,
all "species bonæ" were "malæ." There may be observed in the manifold
skeletal forms of the Radiolaria, on the one hand, the utmost accuracy of
configuration, and on the other, the greatest variability, and hence a
careful comparative study of them leads to a firm conviction of the gradual
"Transformation of Species," and of the truth of the "Theory of Descent."


157. _Palæontological Development._--The palæontology of the Radiolaria
already offers very considerable material for study; but in consequence of
its incompleteness this is of little value for the study of the phylogeny
of the class. By far the larger portion of the fossil Radiolaria belong to
the Tertiary period; only quite recently have numerous well-preserved
fossil Radiolaria been described from the Mesozoic period, and especially
from the Jura. Of Palæozoic Radiolaria (from the coal measures) only slight
traces are known. Moreover, the fossil Radiolaria hitherto known have been
found only in very circumscribed and widely separated localities. The
majority of all the species belong to the small island of Barbados.
Although our palæontological acquaintance with the Radiolaria must
necessarily be incomplete for this reason, it is still more so since at
least thirty out of the eighty-five families (that is more than a third)
could not possibly leave any fossil remains, either because they possess no
skeleton, or because of its chemical composition.

  Of the four legions of the Radiolaria, the ACANTHARIA (on account of the
  solubility of their astroid acanthin skeletons) have entirely vanished
  and have never been found fossil. Of the PHÆODARIA, whose silicate
  skeleton is not as a rule capable of fossilisation, only one section
  (Dictyochida) of a single family (Cannorrhaphida) has been observed
  fossil. Hence the fossil remains of the Radiolaria belong almost
  exclusively to the two legions, SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, which were
  formerly united under the term "Polycystina." Among these, however, the
  skeletonless Thalassicollida, Collozoida, and Nassellida could leave no
  traces. Hence there only remain fifty-five families of which we might
  expect to find fossil siliceous skeletons. Even of these, however,
  scarcely the half are certainly known in the fossil condition, whilst of
  the remainder nothing certain is known; for example, of the large order
  #Larcoidea# (among the SPUMELLARIA) and of the #Stephoidea# (among the
  NASSELLARIA) with a few isolated exceptions, no fossils are known. The
  great majority of fossil Radiolaria belong to the two NASSELLARIAN orders
  #Cyrtoidea# and #Spyroidea# (two relatively very highly developed
  groups); next to these follow the orders {cv}#Discoidea# and #Sphæroidea#
  among the SPUMELLARIA. From these palæontological facts it is obvious
  that our present very incomplete acquaintance with the fossil Radiolaria
  is quite insufficient to warrant us in drawing any conclusions from it
  regarding the phylogenetic development or palæontological succession of
  the individual groups.


158. _Origin of the Four Legions._--The agreement of all Radiolaria in
those constant and essential characters of the unicellular body, which
distinguish them from all other Protista (especially the differentiation of
the malacoma into a central capsule and extracapsulum), justifies the
conclusion that all members of this class have been developed from a common
undifferentiated stem-form. Only the simplest form of the SPUMELLARIA, a
skeletonless spherical cell with concentric spherical nucleus and calymma,
can be regarded as such. The simplest form of the Thalassicollida which is
now extant (_Actissa_, _Procyttarium_, p. 12), corresponds so exactly to
the morphological idea of that hypothetical stem-form that it may
unhesitatingly be regarded in a natural system as the common point of
origin of the whole class. On the other hand, _Actissa_ is so closely
related to the simple Heliozoa (_Actinophrys_, _Actinosphærium_,
_Heterophrys_, _Sphærastrum_, &c.) that its origin from this group of
Rhizopoda is exceedingly probable. The three legions ACANTHARIA,
NASSELLARIA, and PHÆODARIA are to be regarded as three main diverging
branches of the genealogical tree, which have been developed in different
directions and are only connected by their simplest stem-forms
(_Actinelius_, _Nassella_, _Phæodina_) with the stem-form of the
SPUMELLARIA, the primordial _Actissa_.


159. _Phylogeny of the Spumellaria._--The legion SPUMELLARIA or PERIPYLEA
is to be regarded as the common stem-group of the Radiolaria, and its
simplest form, _Actissa_, as the primitive genus or radical form of the
whole class; for it possesses in the simplest and most undifferentiated
form all those characters by which the Radiolaria are distinguished from
other Protista; all the other genera of the class may be derived from it by
successive modifications. Considered as a legion the whole group
SPUMELLARIA is undoubtedly monophyletic, for all its members possess those
essential characters by which it is distinctively marked off from the other
three legions, more especially a simple capsule-membrane, which is
everywhere evenly perforated by innumerable small pores; the nucleus lies
originally in the centre of the spherical central capsule. Furthermore, all
SPUMELLARIA lack those positive characters which distinguish the three
remaining legions--the centrogenous acanthin skeleton of the ACANTHARIA,
the basal porochora and the monaxon podoconus of the NASSELLARIA, the
astropyle and phæodium of the PHÆODARIA.


160. _Origin of the Spumellaria._--The genus _Actissa_ (p. 12, Pl. 1, fig.
1) presents the Radiolarian type in its simplest and most primitive form--a
spherical central capsule, which encloses in its middle a spherical
nucleus, and which is surrounded by a spherical calymma. The whole
unicellular body consists, therefore, of three concentric spheres, {cvi}and
possesses neither skeleton nor alveoles, nor other differentiated parts.
The innumerable fine pseudopodia, which issue from the central capsule
through the evenly distributed pores in its membrane, radiate in all
directions through the calymma and pass out over its surface. _Actissa_
can, therefore, be directly derived phylogenetically from the simplest
skeletonless Heliozoa (_Actinophrys_, _Heterophrys_, _Actinosphærium_,
_Sphærastrum_). The only essential difference between the two consists in
the development of the _central capsule_, which in _Actissa_ separates as a
distinct membrane the endoplasm from the exoplasm. This differentiation
which we regard is the most important distinguishing character of the
Radiolaria, has been transmitted by inheritance, along with the formation
of flagellate spores in the central capsule, from _Actissa_, the primitive
parent to all the other Radiolaria.

{cviii}162. _Collodaria and Sphærellaria._--Whilst in all SPUMELLARIA the
malacoma agrees in possessing the characteristic features of the legion,
and thus justifies its derivation monophyletically from the common
stem-form _Actissa_, the different forms of skeleton, on the other hand,
cannot all be referred to the same fundamental form. More especially the
_spherical lattice-shell_, from which all the numerous skeletal forms of
the #Sphærellaria# may be derived, cannot have arisen from the incomplete
Beloid skeleton which characterises the #Beloidea# among the #Collodaria#.
It is probable rather that the formation of the skeleton has taken place
independently in those two groups of SPUMELLARIA. From the skeletonless
#Colloidea#, as the common stem-group of the SPUMELLARIA, two different
main groups have diverged, on the one hand the #Beloidea#, whose skeleton
consists of separate spicules scattered in the extracapsulum, and on the
other hand, the #Sphærellaria#, which have formed a simple lattice-sphere
around the central capsule; from this the manifold forms of the remaining
SPUMELLARIA may be derived.


163. _Descent of the Sphærellaria._--The extensive order #Sphærellaria#,
which includes all SPUMELLARIA with a complete lattice-shell, develops an
extraordinary variety of skeletal structures; these may, nevertheless, all
be derived without violence from a common stem-form, or simple spherical
lattice-shell, _Cenosphæra_. The main stem of the order, the extensive
suborder #Sphæroidea# (Pls. 5-30), is derived immediately from _Cenosphæra_
(p. 61, Pl. 12); three diverging branches of it being represented by the
other three suborders, the #Prunoidea# (Pls. 16, 17, 39, 40) being
developed by elongation, and the #Discoidea# (Pls. 31-48) by shortening of
the vertical main axis, whilst the #Larcoidea# (Pls. 9, 10, 49, 50) have
originated by the modification of the spherical lattice-shell into a
lentelliptical or triaxial ellipsoidal one. Although the monophyletic
derivation of all #Sphærellaria# from _Cenosphæra_ is exceedingly probable,
the possibility of a polyphyletic origin for the group is by no means
excluded. For even in the skeletonless primitive genus of all the
SPUMELLARIA, _Actissa_ (as well as in the social _Collozoum_), there are
found, in addition to the usual spherical types, other species (or
subgenera, p. 12) whose central capsule is not spherical but a modification
of the sphere; in _Actiprunum_ ellipsoidal; in _Actidiscus_ lenticular; in
_Actilarcus_ lentelliptical; if such modified forms of _Actissa_ were to
develop their lattice-shells independently, then their form would
correspond to that of the central capsule; and such simple ellipsoidal,
discoidal, and lentelliptical lattice-shells might have been the primitive
forms of the #Prunoidea#, #Discoidea# and #Larcoidea#.


164. _Genealogical Tree of the Sphæroidea._--_Cenosphæra_, the simplest
form of the spherical lattice-shell, may be unhesitatingly regarded as the
common stem-form of all the #Sphæroidea# (pp. 50-284, Pls. 5-30).
_Cenosphæra_ (p. 61, Pl. 12) arose directly from _Actissa_ simply by the
silicification of the spherical exoplasmatic network of the sarcodictyum
around the central capsule, on the surface of the concentric calymma. From
this simple siliceous extracapsular lattice-sphere all other forms of
#Sphæroidea# have arisen, in the main by the manifold combination of two
simple processes, first by the formation of radial spines on the surface of
the lattice-sphere, and second, the addition of concentric spherical
lattice-shells. Both processes may be utilised as the foundation for a
systematic treatment of the #Sphæroidea# (compare pp. 52-58).

  If in the #Sphæroidea# the characteristic number and disposition of the
  _radial spines_ be regarded as the most important heritable peculiarity
  of the different families, then we have the following natural
  arrangement:--(1) Liosphærida, without radial spines; (2) Cubosphærida,
  with six radial spines (opposite in pairs in three axes perpendicular to
  each other); (3) Staurosphærida, with four radial spines (in two axes
  crossed at right angles); (4) Stylosphærida, with two opposite radial
  spines (in the vertical main axis); and (5) Astrosphærida, with numerous
  regularly or irregularly distributed radial spines (eight to twenty or
  more). If, on the contrary, more stress be laid upon the number of the
  concentric lattice-shells, then we have the following artificial
  grouping:--(1) Monosphærida, with one simple lattice-sphere; (2)
  Dyosphærida, with two concentric lattice-spheres; (3) Triosphærida, with
  three; (4) Tetrasphærida, with four; (5) Polysphærida, with numerous
  (five to twenty or more) concentric lattice-shells; (6) Spongosphærida,
  with a spongy spherical shell. In general the former arrangement appears
  more natural than the latter, since the number of primary radial spines,
  which grow out from the primary lattice-sphere, determines their
  ground-form from the outset, whatever may be the number of secondarily
  added shells. Strictly speaking, according to the view adopted, these
  Liosphærida which have several shells, on the outer surface of which
  there are no radial spines, ought to be classified according to the
  number and arrangement of their internal radial connecting beams and
  distributed among the other families. The practical application of this
  correct principle meets, however, with great difficulties. Also in many
  cases the phylogenetic relations of the different #Sphæroidea# are more
  complicated than would appear from both these classificatory principles.
  In general their phylogeny will quite correspond with their ontogeny,
  since from the innermost first formed {cix}lattice-shell (primary
  medullary shell) a number of radial spines arises, and upon these the
  secondary shells are formed from within outwards.


165. _Genealogical Tree of the Prunoidea._--The suborder #Prunoidea# is
very closely related to the #Sphæroidea#, and is distinguished from it by
the elongation of one axis; from the simple lattice-sphere (_Cenosphæra_)
is developed a latticed ellipsoid (_Cenellipsis_, Pl. 39, fig. 1). The
development of this vertical isopolar main axis is foreshadowed even among
the #Sphæroidea#, in that family in which two opposite radial spines grow
out of the primary lattice-sphere at the two poles of the vertical main
axis (Stylosphærida, Pls. 13, 14). These latter pass over without any sharp
boundary into those forms of #Prunoidea# whose ellipsoidal lattice-shell
bears two opposite main-spines (Stylatractida, Pls. 15, 16). Other very
intimate relationships between the #Sphæroidea# and #Prunoidea# are
indicated in certain of the latter by the fact that of the two concentric
lattice-shells the inner (medullary) shell is spherical, the outer
(cortical) shell ellipsoidal (Pl. 39, figs. 3, 7, 8, 14, 19); often three
concentric lattice-shells are present, of which the two inner are spherical
intracapsular medullary shells, whilst the outer is an extracapsular
cortical shell, ellipsoidal or cylindrical in form (Pl. 39, figs. 4, 12,
17, 18). Owing to the manifold nature of these phylogenetical relations and
the variety of their combinations, the derivation of the individual
#Prunoidea# from the #Sphæroidea# is rendered very difficult; in addition
to which it is possible that the simplest #Prunoidea# (_Cenellipsis_,
_Ellipsidium_) have been directly developed from the skeletonless
_Actiprunum_ (a form of _Actissa_ with ellipsoidal central capsule, p. 14)
by the excretion of a simple ellipsoidal lattice-shell on the surface of
their calymma.

  The phylogeny of the #Prunoidea# is especially complicated by the
  formation of peculiar transverse constrictions, perpendicular to the
  longitudinal axis. They are wanting only in the Monoprunida (Ellipsida,
  Druppulida, and Spongurida); the Dyoprunida (Artiscida and Cyphinida, Pl.
  39, figs. 9-19) possess only one such constriction (in the equatorial
  plane); the Polyprunida, on the other hand, have three, five, or more
  parallel constrictions (Panartida and Zygartida, Pl. 40). The chambers,
  which are separated off by these constrictions, may be regarded as polar
  sections of incomplete cortical shells.


166. _Genealogical Tree of the Discoidea._--The suborder #Discoidea# is
closely related to the #Sphæroidea#, but separated from it by shortening of
one axis; from a simple lattice-sphere (_Cenosphæra_) a latticed lens or
flattened spheroid is developed, whose circular equatorial plane is larger
than any other section (_Cenodiscus_, Pl. 48, fig. 1). The formation of
this horizontal equatorial plane is perhaps indicated in that family of
#Sphæroidea# in which four crossed radial spines, lying in one plane, are
developed (Staurosphærida, Pls. 15, 31, 42). The morphological and
phylogenetical relations of the #Discoidea# to the #Sphæroidea# are
precisely the converse of those of the #Prunoidea#; in the latter the
vertical axis appears longer, in the former shorter than any {cx}other axis
of the body. The #Discoidea# are probably polyphyletic, having originated
from several different groups of #Sphæroidea#; at least two essentially
different main groups may be distinguished among them; of these the one is
characterised by the formation of a large extracapsular lenticular cortical
shell (Phacodiscaria), whilst in the other this typical "Phacoid shell" or
lattice-lens is wanting (Cyclodiscaria, compare pp. 403-409).

  The Phacodiscida (Pls. 31-35) perhaps constitute the primitive group of
  the Phacodiscaria, their lenticular or Phacoid cortical shell being
  connected by radial bars with one or two concentric spherical medullary
  shells; they may have originated directly from the Dyosphærida or
  Triosphærida by flattening of the spheroidal cortical shell. From the
  Phacodiscida the Cenodiscida (if indeed they be not the primitive
  stem-form) have been developed by retrogression and loss of those
  medullary shells. The Coccodiscida (Pls. 36-38), on the other hand, have
  been developed from the Phacodiscida by the addition of concentric rings
  of chambers, which may be regarded as incomplete cortical shells, only
  the equatorial portion of which is developed. Perhaps the Porodiscida,
  the primitive group of the Cyclodiscaria, have arisen in a similar way;
  they lack, however, the typical Phacoid shell, the concentric rings of
  chambers being directly applied to a small spherical medullary shell in
  the equatorial plane (Pls. 41-46). If those rings from the commencement
  be interrupted by three interradial gaps (gates) the family Pylodiscida
  arises (Pl. 38, figs. 6-20). If, on the contrary, the concentric radially
  divided chambers of the Porodiscida become quite irregular and spongy,
  they pass over into the Spongodiscida (Pls. 46, 47). It is not, however,
  impossible that part of the #Discoidea# (especially the Cenodiscida) have
  originated directly from skeletonless #Collodaria# with a lenticular
  central capsule, such as are found in a subgenus of _Actissa_
  (_Actidiscus_, p. 15).


167. _Genealogical Tree of the Larcoidea._--The suborder #Larcoidea#
presents in the structure, composition, and development of its variously
formed lattice-shells much more complicated relations than the other
#Sphærellaria#; it is essentially distinguished from them by the
characteristic ground-form of its lattice-shells, which is a "lentellipsis"
or a triaxial ellipsoid (also the ground-form of the rhombic
crystallographic system, the rhombic octahedron). Hence all parts of the
body are regularly disposed with respect to three different dimensive axes;
all three axes, perpendicular one to another, are isopolar but of different
lengths; the longest is the vertical main axis, the mean the horizontal
frontal axis, the shortest the horizontal sagittal axis. In the great
majority of the #Larcoidea# the lentelliptical ground-form is indicated in
the central capsule, even when it is not at once obvious in the skeleton.
Since such lentelliptical central capsules are developed even in _Actissa_
(_Actilarcus_, p. 16), it is possible that the simplest #Larcoidea# may
have arisen directly from these by deposition of a simple lentelliptical
lattice-shell in the sarcodictyum, on the surface of the calymma
(_Cenolarcus_, Pl. 50, fig. 7). It is more probable, however, that these
simplest forms (_Cenolarcus_, _Larcarium_) have been developed from the
simplest #Sphæroidea# (_Cenosphæra_), by the spherical body growing
unequally in the three dimensions of space. It appears especially likely
{cxi}from a study of the concentrically disposed lattice-shells of some
#Larcoidea# (_Coccolarcus_, _Larcidium_, Pl. 50, fig. 8), in which the
inner medullary shell is spherical, the outer cortical shell more or less
elliptical. In the great majority of #Larcoidea# the latter arises in quite
a peculiar manner, three broad lattice-zones, which are developed in three
planes at right angles to each other, growing out from a small spherical or
lentelliptical medullary shell, _Trizonium_, _Larnacilla_ (compare pp. 600,
615, 628, &c.).

  The trizonal _Larnacilla_-shell commences by the formation of a
  transverse girdle, by the union of two lateral latticed processes, which
  spring right and left in the equatorial plane from the poles of the
  frontal axis of a lentelliptical medullary shell (_Monozonium_, p. 633,
  Pl. 9, fig. 1). This is followed by a second lateral girdle, which lies
  in the frontal plane and proceeds from its lateral poles (_Dizonium_, p.
  634, Pl. 9, figs. 2, 3). Finally the sagittal girdle is formed, lying in
  the sagittal plane and arising from the lateral girdle on the two poles
  of the main axis (_Trizonium_, p. 637, Pl. 9, fig. 4). Whilst the gaps
  between the three zones of this trizonal shell remain open in the
  Pylonida, in _Larnacilla_, the important primitive form of the Larnacida,
  they are closed by lattice-work (Pl. 50, figs. 3-8). From this trizonal
  _Larnacilla_-shell the great majority of Larcoid shells may be derived.
  Such a system of zones may be repeated (Diplozonaria) or even developed a
  third time (Triplozonaria, p. 632). In most #Larcoidea# the zones are
  secondarily connected by lattice-work. In the Tholonida (Pl. 10) each of
  the two opposite latticed wings of a zone becomes a closed dome. In the
  Zonarida (Pl. 50, figs. 9-12) these domes are partially or wholly
  bisected by constrictions or latticed septa which are developed in the
  three dimensive planes. The Lithelida (Pl. 49, figs. 1-7) are
  characterised by the fact that one of each pair of opposite latticed
  processes (or half zones) grows more strongly than the other, and that
  the larger completely embraces the smaller so as to form a complicated
  spiral. Whilst in this case the spiral lies in a plane, in the
  Streblonida (Pl. 49, figs. 8, 9) it becomes turbinoid like a gastropod
  shell and forms an ascending spiral. Finally, two small families of
  #Larcoidea# are characterised by quite irregular growth (a very rare
  occurrence among the Radiolaria); these are the simple-chambered
  Phorticida (Pl. 49, figs. 10, 11) and the many chambered Soreumida (Pl.
  49, figs. 12, 13). The phylogenetic relationship of these families of
  #Larcoidea# is probably very complicated and demands closer investigation
  (compare pp. 599-604).


168. _Descent of the Polycyttaria._--The polyzootic or colonial Radiolaria,
which we unite in the group Polycyttaria (sometimes known as "Sphærozoea"),
belong without doubt to the legion SPUMELLARIA, for they possess all the
peculiarities by which these PERIPYLEA are distinguished from the other
legions of the Radiolaria. Only the morphological position of the
Polycyttaria in that legion, and their phylogenetic relation to the
monozootic or solitary SPUMELLARIA, can be variously interpreted. The three
families which we distinguish among the Polycyttaria are so closely related
to three different families of the Monocyttaria, that they may be directly
derived from them by the formation of colonies. According to this
_triphyletic hypothesis_ the social skeletonless Collozoida (Pl. 3) would
be descended from the solitary Thalassicollida (Pl. 1), the polyzootic
Sphærozoida with a Beloid skeleton (Pl. 4) from the monozootic
{cxii}Thalassosphærida (Pl. 2), and the colonial Collosphærida with a
Sphæroid skeleton (Pls. 5-8) from the solitary Ethmosphærida (Pl. 12, &c.).
Many species of monozootic and polyzootic forms in all three groups are so
alike that they can only be distinguished by the fact that the one series
are colonial, the others solitary. On the other hand, there are some
reasons which would justify a monophyletic hypothesis for the Polycyttaria,
_e.g._, the precocious nuclear division; in this case it would be most
natural to hold that the Sphærozoida and Collosphærida have arisen as two
diverging branches from the Collozoida, whilst the latter are nothing else
than colonial Thalassicollida.


169. _Phylogeny of the Acantharia._--The legion ACANTHARIA or ACTIPYLEA is
distinguished by its peculiar acanthin skeleton, which develops
centrogenously, as well as by the disposition in groups of the pores in its
central capsule, and its excentric usually precocious nucleus; it is thus
so different from all other Radiolaria as undoubtedly to furnish,
phylogenetically considered, an independent stem (§ 7). This stem is only
connected at the root by _Actinelius_ with the primitive form of the
SPUMELLARIA, _Actissa_. The stem is monophyletic, since all the forms
belonging to it may be derived without violence from _Actinelius_ as a
common primitive form.


170. _Origin of the Acantharia._--The genus _Actinelius_ (p. 730, Pl. 129,
fig. 1), which may naturally be regarded as the common primitive form of
all ACANTHARIA, possesses a spherical central capsule, which in consequence
of the early division of the nucleus (§ 63), encloses numerous small
nuclei; from its centre arise many simple radial spines of equal size,
which penetrate the central capsule. A large number of radial pseudopodia
issue between the spines from the sarcomatrix which surrounds the capsule.
_Actinelius_ may have been directly derived from _Actissa_, the common
stem-form of all Radiolaria, by the division of the pseudopodia into two
groups, myxopodia, which remained soft, and axopodia, which became firm (§
95A). As the latter became changed into strong acanthin rods, and touched
each other in the centre, they forced the nucleus from its originally
central position and brought about its early division. _Actinelius_ is also
of all Radiolaria the form which, next to _Actissa_, most nearly approaches
the Heliozoa. If the stiff axial threads of _Actinosphærium_ be conceived
of as partially converted into acanthin spines, and its nucleated medullary
substance as separated from the alveolar cortical layer by a membrane
(central capsule), then _Actinelius_ would be produced.

{cxiv}172. _Adelacantha and Icosacantha._--The numerous forms of
ACANTHARIA, here disposed in twelve families and sixty-five genera, may be
divided phylogenetically into two main groups of very different
extent--_Adelacantha_ and _Icosacantha_. The more primitive group,
_Adelacantha_, have an indefinite and variable number of radial spines,
which are always quite simple in form and usually irregularly distributed;
this main division includes only the one order #Actinelida#, with six
genera, among which is _Actinelius_, the common stem-form of all the
ACANTHARIA. The more recent group, Icosacantha, includes all the other
ACANTHARIA (fifty-nine genera), and is very markedly distinguished from the
Adelacantha by the fact that the radial spines are always twenty in number,
and arranged according to Müller's law (compare pp. 717-725, and § 110).
Since this regular disposition (in five alternating zones each of four
spines) has been retained by inheritance in the whole of the Icosacantha,
it is probable that this large group has been developed monophyletically
from a twig of the Adelacantha; _Actinastrum_ (p. 732) and _Chiastolus_ (p.
738) still present connecting links between the former and the latter,
between _Actinelius_ and _Acanthometron_.


173. _Acanthonida and Acanthophracta._--The extensive main division
Icosacantha (§ 110), which embraces all ACANTHARIA with twenty radial
spines, disposed according to Müller's law, may be subdivided into two
large groups or orders:--the #Acanthonida# (p. 740, Pls. 130-132) and the
#Acanthophracta# (p. 791, Pls. 133-140). The latter possess a complete
extracapsular lattice-shell, which the former have not. The more recent
#Acanthophracta# may be derived phylogenetically from the more primitive
#Acanthonida# simply by the development of this lattice-shell, with which
process are usually (perhaps always) connected certain alterations in the
malacoma, _e.g._, degeneration of the myophriscs (§ 96). The most primitive
form of all Icosacantha is the genus _Acanthometron_ (p. 324), in which all
the twenty acanthin spines are of the simplest constitution and of equal
dimensions.


174. _Differentiation of the Acanthonida._--The order #Acanthonida#, which
embraces all Icosacantha which have no complete lattice-shell, divides
early into three main branches, the three families Astrolonchida,
Quadrilonchida, and Amphilonchida (p. 727, Pls. 130-132). The first of
these constitutes the common stem-group from which the other two as well as
the whole group #Acanthophracta# have been developed; the common stem-form
of all is _Acanthometron_ (§ 173). All the Astrolonchida (p. 740, Pl. 130)
have twenty radial spines of equal size and similar form. On the other
hand, in the Quadrilonchida (p. 766, Pl. 131) the four equatorial spines
differ from the others in size and sometimes also in form. In the
Amphilonchida (p. 781, Pl. 132) two opposite equatorial spines (lying in
the hydrotomical axis) are much larger than the other eighteen and of a
different shape. Of the three families of the #Acanthonida# the most
important is the primitive group Astrolonchida, for from this the various
stem-forms of the #Acanthophracta# arise. They are subdivided according to
the formation of the spines into three subfamilies: the Zygacanthida, with
simple spines without apophyses (or transverse processes); the
Phractacanthida, with two opposite apophyses on each radial {cxv}spine, and
the Stauracanthida, with four crossed apophyses on each radial spine. The
three genera of the Zygacanthida represent the stem-forms of the three
families, since the radial spines in _Acanthometron_ (the most primitive
form of #Acanthonida#) are cylindrical, in _Zygacantha_ two-edged, and in
_Acanthonia_ four-edged (p. 741).


175. _Capsophracta and Cladophracta._--The extensive order
#Acanthophracta#, which embraces all ACANTHARIA with a complete
lattice-shell, is polyphyletic, its main subdivisions have been developed
independently from different branches of the #Acanthonida#. The whole order
may be divided directly into two main groups, the #Capsophracta# and
#Cladophracta# (p. 793), which differ in the structure and the origin of
their lattice-shell. The group (or suborder) #Capsophracta# includes only
the single family Sphærocapsida (p. 795, Pl. 133, figs. 7-11; Pl. 135,
figs. 6-10); the lattice-shell arises independently of the twenty radial
spines, being made up like a pavement of innumerable small acanthin plates,
united by a kind of cement; each plate being perforated by a fine pore. In
addition twenty larger main pores (or groups of four pores each) are
present, corresponding to the twenty radial spines; these are always equal,
quadrangular prismatic, without transverse processes as in _Acanthonia_. In
the #Cladophracta#, which include the five remaining families of the
#Acanthophracta#, the structure and origin of the lattice-shell are quite
different; the lattice-shell is here made up of the branches of the
transverse processes, which radiate tangentially from the twenty radial
spines and are only united secondarily.


176. _Ascent of the Dorataspida._--The group #Cladophracta#, or those
ACANTHARIA whose lattice-shell arises by the union of transverse
processes of the twenty radial spines, includes five different
families, whose stem-group is the family Dorataspida, with a simple
spherical lattice-shell. This family itself is, however, diphyletic in
origin, being composed of two essentially and originally different
subfamilies--Diporaspida and Tessaraspida (p. 803). The Diporaspida (p.
808, Pls. 137, 138) have been developed from the Phractacanthida, and as
each radial spine of the latter bears two opposite apophyses, so the
lattice-shell of the former has forty primary aspinal pores (two on the
base of each spine). On the other hand, the Tessaraspida (p. 830, Pls. 135,
136) have been developed from the Stauracanthida, and as each radial spine
of the latter bears four crossed apophyses, so the lattice-shell of the
former has eighty primary aspinal pores (four at the base of each spine).


177. _Descent of the Diporaspida._--Whilst the Tessaraspida (§ 176) have
given rise to no new groups which could take rank as independent families,
no less than four separate families of ACANTHARIA have arisen from the
Diporaspida. The Phractopeltida (Pl. 133, figs. 1-6) are distinguished from
all other ACANTHARIA by the possession of two concentric spherical
lattice-shells, and have probably been developed from the {cxvi}Diporaspida
in the same way as the Dyosphærida from the Monosphærida among the
#Sphæroidea#; in that case the smaller inner lattice-sphere (medullary
shell) would be the primary, and the larger outer sphere (cortical shell)
the secondary; this latter shows forty primary aspinal pores like those of
the Diporaspida. The possibility is not excluded, however, that the small
inner lattice-sphere of the Phractopeltida is a secondary product. The
three remaining families, which must be regarded as descendants of the
Diporaspida, form together a single phylogenetic series, and are separated
from the primitive group mainly by the fact that the original spherical
form of the lattice-shell has been modified into one distinguished by an
elongated equatorial axis (the hydrotomical axis); hence the #Prunophracta#
(pp. 794-859). The ellipsoidal Belonaspida have arisen directly by
hypertrophy of the two opposite equatorial spines of this hydrotomical axis
(p. 859, Pl. 136, figs. 6-9; Pl. 139, figs. 8, 9; perhaps they have also
arisen directly from the Amphilonchida). In the lentelliptical Hexalaspida
(Pl. 139) all six spines which lie in the hydrotomical meridian plane (two
equatorial and four polar) are very strongly developed, the remaining
fourteen being rudimentary. Finally, in the Diploconida the two conical
sheaths of the two opposite hydrotomical equatorial spines are so
predominant that they take the chief part in the formation of the
hour-glass-shaped shell.


178. _Phylogeny of the Nassellaria._--The legion NASSELLARIA or MONOPYLEA
is so clearly characterised by the peculiar porochora, which closes the
osculum at the oral pole of the monaxon central capsule, and by the
podoconus connected with it, that there can be no doubt that
phylogenetically it represents an independent stem (§ 8). This stem is only
connected at its base by means of _Cystidium_ and _Nassella_ with _Actissa_
and _Thalassicolla_, the stem-forms of the SPUMELLARIA. This stem is
monophyletic, inasmuch as all its members may be derived without violence
from the skeletonless Nassellida (_Nassella_, _Cystidium_, p. 896, Pl. 91,
fig. 1).


179. _Origin of the Nassellaria._--The Nassellida (p. 896), which may
naturally be considered as the common stem-group of the NASSELLARIA, are
most nearly related among other Radiolaria to the Thalassicollida, and in
both these skeletonless families the simplest forms, _Cystidium_ and
_Actissa_ correspond; on the other hand, those which have arisen from them
by the formation of alveoles in the calymma (_Nassella_ and
_Thalassicolla_) also correspond. The origin of the simplest Nassellida
from these primitive Thalassicollida may be explained by supposing that the
numerous (formerly evenly distributed) pores of the capsule membrane became
obliterated in the upper (apical) half of the central capsule, whilst in
the lower (basal) half they became correspondingly more strongly developed;
hence the porochora was formed at the oral pole of the vertical main axis,
and a differentiation of the endoplasm proceeding from this gave rise to
the characteristic podoconus. Both these organs still at present exhibit
very various degrees of progressive development.

{cxviii}181. _Plectellaria and Cyrtellaria._--The extensive legion
NASSELLARIA far surpasses the other three legions in the endless variety of
its skeletal structures, and owing to the complicated relationships of its
numerous families presents no lack of difficult phylogenetic problems. All
NASSELLARIA may be divided first into two main groups or sublegions,
#Plectellaria# and #Cyrtellaria#; the latter having a complete
lattice-shell, the former not. Probably the #Cyrtellaria# have been
polyphyletically developed from several different groups of #Plectellaria#.
These groups are, however, connected in such manifold ways that a
monophyletic origin of all the NASSELLARIAN skeletons from one original
element is possible. Such a primitive element may have been furnished by
any one of three different skeletal parts, the sagittal ring, the basal
tripod, and the latticed cephalis (compare pp. 891-895, Bütschli, L. N. 40,
41).


182. _Phylogenetic Skeletal Elements of the Nassellaria._--The multiform
skeleton of the NASSELLARIA may be referred in different ways to one of the
three above-mentioned structural elements. Each of these (p. 891) may by
itself form the skeleton; the sagittal ring in the simplest #Stephoidea#
(_Archicircus_, _Lithocircus_), the basal tripod in the simplest
#Plectoidea# (_Triplagia_, _Plagiacantha_), the latticed cephalis in the
simplest #Cyrtoidea# (_Cyrtocalpis_, _Archicapsa_). In the great majority
of the NASSELLARIA, however, two of these elements, or even all three, are
found combined. In most #Cyrtellaria#, more especially, both the sagittal
ring and the basal tripod may be recognised in the lattice-shell, though
often only in slight rudiments or scarcely perceptible traces. In the
#Plectellaria# also (which possess no latticed cephalis) there are
individual genera with complete development both of the sagittal ring and
basal tripod; this important combination is especially well represented in
the Cortinida (_Cortina_, _Cortiniscus_, _Stephanium_, _Stephaniscus_,
_Tripocoronis_, &c.). The greatest difficulty as regards the phylogeny of
the NASSELLARIA lies in the fact that the most various combinations of the
three elements are presented by closely related or very similar forms. If,
in spite of this, a monophyletic hypothesis as to the origin of the
NASSELLARIA seems essential all sides of the three possible hypotheses must
receive full consideration and critical comparison (§§ 183-191).


183. _Ascent of the Nassellaria from the Plectoidea._--The monophyletic
hypothesis (No. 2, p. 893) which regards the basal tripod as the common
origin of the skeleton of all NASSELLARIA, starts from the simplest forms
of the #Plectoidea# (_Triplagia_, _Plagoniscus_, _Triplecta_,
_Plectaniscus_, &c., Pl. 91). All #Plectoidea# may be immediately derived
as diverging twigs of these, as well as all triradial and multiradial forms
of #Cyrtoidea# and #Spyroidea#; for in all these cases the distinctive
triradial (or the derived multiradial) form of skeleton appears directly
derivable from the simple basal tripod of the former. The same is perhaps
also true of many #Botryodea#. {cxix}Furthermore, certain important forms
of #Stephoidea# (_Cortina_, _Cortiniscus_, _Stephanium_, _Stephaniscus_,
&c.), which have a characteristic combination of the sagittal ring and
basal tripod, may be immediately derived from such forms of #Plectoidea# as
_Plagoniscus cortinaris_, _Plagiocarpa procortina_, _Plectaniscus
cortiniscus_, &c. On the contrary, those #Stephoidea# and #Cyrtoidea# in
which the basal tripod is wanting can only be derived from the #Plectoidea#
by the assumption that this structure has disappeared in consequence of
phylogenetic degeneration. The monophyletic derivation of the NASSELLARIA
from the #Plectoidea# has more internal probability than that from the
#Stephoidea#, since it is easier to suppose that the Cortinida (_Cortina_,
_Stephanium_, &c.) have been derived from the #Plectoidea# (_Plagoniscus_,
_Plagiocarpa_) than the converse. This view is the basis of the
hypothetical tree shown in § 180.


184. _Ascent of the Nassellaria from the Stephoidea._--The monophyletic
hypothesis (No. 1, p. 893) which regards the primary sagittal ring as the
common starting point of the skeleton in all NASSELLARIA, starts from the
simplest forms of #Stephoidea# (_Archicircus_, _Lithocircus_, &c., Pl. 81).
All #Stephoidea# and #Spyroidea# may be immediately derived from these, as
also the majority of the #Cyrtoidea# and probably of the #Botryodea#. Those
numerous forms of the last two groups, however, which possess no trace of a
sagittal ring, can only be derived from the former by the supposition that
the latter has completely disappeared in in consequence of gradual
phylogenetic degeneration. The same holds true also of the #Plectoidea#,
although certain forms (_e.g._, _Plagiocarpa procortina_, Pl. 91, fig. 5;
_Plectaniscus cortiniscus_, Pl. 91, fig. 9) appear to indicate the
commencing formation of the sagittal ring by the concrescence of two
branches, which approach each other from the upper part of the apical rod
and the ventral part of the basal rod. In any case, it is a fact of great
phylogenetic significance, that the primary sagittal ring in the cephalis
of the #Cyrtoidea# shows all conceivable stages of degeneration (compare
Bütschli, L. N. 40, 41, as well as the general account of and critical
comparison of the NASSELLARIA, pp. 889-895, &c.).


185. _Ascent of the Nassellaria from the Cyrtoidea._--The monophyletic
hypothesis (No. 3, p. 894) which regards the latticed cephalis as the
common point of origin of all the skeletons of the NASSELLARIA, starts from
the simplest forms of the #Cyrtoidea#, that is, from the Cyrtocalpida or
eradial Monocyrtida (_Archicorida_, _Archicapsida_, Pls. 51, 52, 98). All
#Cyrtoidea# and #Botryodea# may be regarded as divergent forms of these
monothalamous #Cyrtoidea#; the polythalamous simply by the addition of
fresh joints at the basal pole, the triradiate and multiradiate by the
development of three or more apophyses. The origin of the sagittal ring
(which presents every stage of development and degeneration in the
#Cyrtoidea#) may be regarded as a mechanical thickening of the latticed
plate in the sagittal circumference of the cephalis. By stronger
{cxx}development of this ring and coincident sagittal constriction of the
cephalis the order #Spyroidea# may be derived from the #Cyrtoidea#.  On the
other hand, the #Plectellaria#, which possess no cephalis, and indeed no
complete lattice-shell whatever, may be derived from the Monocyrtida by the
assumption of a degeneration of this structure; the sagittal ring having
been preserved in the #Stephoidea#, and the tripod of the Tripocalpida in
the #Plectoidea#. Although such a monophyletic derivation of the
NASSELLARIA from the Cyrtocalpida is possible, and though here, too, the
Cortinida play an important part as connecting links, this hypothesis has
less internal probability than that of the derivation from the #Stephoidea#
(§ 184) or #Plectoidea# (§ 183).


186. _Genealogical Tree of the Plectoidea._--The order #Plectoidea#
includes those NASSELLARIA whose rudimentary skeleton does not contain the
characteristic sagittal ring of the #Stephoidea#, but consists of several
(at least three) radial spines, which proceed from a point in the centre of
the porochora. The branches of these radial spines remain free in the
Plagonida, whilst in the Plectanida they unite with each other to form a
loose meshwork (not, however, a complete lattice-shell). The number and
arrangement of the radial spines, which serve for generic distinctions, are
the same in both families, so that each genus of the Plectanida has arisen
from a corresponding genus of the Plagonida. The simplest Plagonida, which
possess a basal tripod (_Triplagia_ or _Plagiacantha_ with three rays,
_Tetraplagia_ with four rays) are probably to be regarded as forming the
common origin of the whole order. These agree with certain three- and
four-rayed skeletal pieces of the #Beloidea# (Thalassosphærida and
Sphærozoida); and also the four and six-rayed twinned pieces of the latter
(spicula bigemina and trigemina) repeat in the same fashion the skeleton of
the former (_Plagonidium_, _Plagonium_). This similarity, however, is a
mere analogy and possesses no phylogenetic significance. On the other hand,
certain Plagonida (_Plagoniscus_, _Plagiocarpa_), and the corresponding
genera of Plectanida (_Plectaniscus_, _Periplecta_) seem to have important
phylogenetic relations to certain #Stephoidea# (_Cortina_, _Cortiniscus_,
&c.); the sagittal ring of the latter having perhaps arisen by the vertical
apical spine of the former having been connected with their horizontal
basal rod by two ventral apophyses growing out opposite to each other
(compare pp. 902, 914, _Plagiocarpa procortina_, Pl. 91, fig. 5). In this
case the Plectanida would belong to the simplest stem-forms of the
NASSELLARIA.


187. _Genealogical Tree of the Stephoidea._--The order #Stephoidea#
includes all those NASSELLARIA whose skeleton does not form a complete
lattice-shell, but consists of one or more rings, and often of a loose
meshwork which arises by the union of branches of the rings. A _vertical
sagittal ring_ is constantly present, embracing the central capsule in the
median sagittal plane, and forming at its basal pole various processes, the
starting point for other skeletal forms. The most important of these is the
tripodal _Cortina_ {cxxi}(p. 950, § 182). The Stephanida are the most
archaic family among the #Stephoidea# (p. 937, Pl. 81), perhaps indeed
among all the NASSELLARIA (§ 184); in them the sagittal ring and its
processes alone constitute the skeleton; secondary rings and meshes are
wanting. Two diverging families, the Semantida and Coronida, have been
developed from the Stephanida, and from one of them the family Tympanida
has arisen.

  The Semantida (p. 953, Pl. 92) develop a horizontal basal ring at the
  oral side of the vertical sagittal ring; the basal meshes or lattice
  gates, which remain between the former and the latter, are the important
  cortinar pores (one pair jugular, one pair cardinal, p. 954); they
  usually appear inherited in the cortinar septum of the #Cyrtellaria#. In
  the Coronida (p. 967, Pls. 82, 94) a second vertical ring (the frontal
  ring) appears in addition to the sagittal ring; it lies in the frontal
  plane at right angles to the latter. Finally the Tympanida (p. 987, Pls.
  93, 94) have probably arisen from the Semantida by the formation of a
  second horizontal ring (mitral ring) parallel to the basal and attached
  to the upper portion of the sagittal ring.


188. _Genealogical Tree of the Spyroidea._--The extensive order #Spyroidea#
is of especial interest in connection with the phylogeny of the
NASSELLARIA, since all its members show two well-developed skeletal
elements in combination, the sagittal ring of the #Stephoidea# and the
latticed cephalis of the #Cyrtoidea#; the majority possess also the basal
tripod of the #Plectoidea# (or a radial skeleton derived from it). Hence
there is a possibility of deriving the stem-forms of the #Spyroidea# from
each of these three groups. The four families of this order exhibit similar
relationships to those of the four families of #Cyrtoidea#; the common
stem-group is the family Zygospyrida; from this the Tholospyrida have
arisen by the development of a galea on the apical pole, the Phormospyrida
by the addition of a thorax on the basal pole. The Androspyrida may be
derived either from the Tholospyrida by the formation of a basal thorax, or
from the Phormospyrida by the development of an apical galea. Some groups,
however, such as the peculiar Nephrospyrida (Pl. 90) have probably been
developed directly from the #Stephoidea#.


189. _Genealogical Tree of the Botryodea._--The peculiar order #Botryodea#
(p. 1103), which is both difficult to investigate and insufficiently known,
presents great phylogenetic difficulties both as to its ascent and descent.
Probably the different genera of this order have been polyphyletically
developed from different groups of #Cyrtoidea# (perhaps also to some extent
of #Spyroidea#) by the formation of lobes in the cephalis. The three
families of #Botryodea# are related to each other in the same way as are
the three first families of the #Cyrtoidea#. From the single-jointed
Cannobotryida (corresponding to the Monocyrtida), the two-jointed
Lithobotryida (corresponding to the Dicyrtida), may be derived by the
development of a basal thorax, and from the latter the three-jointed
Pylobotryida (like the Tricyrtida) by the addition of an abdomen. In the
last two families the forms with an open basal mouth {cxxii}(Botryopylida
and Botryocyrtida) are to be regarded as primitive: the Botryocellida and
Botryocampida have arisen by the closure of this mouth with a basal
lattice-plate.


190. _Genealogical Tree of the Cyrtoidea._--The multiform and extensive
group #Cyrtoidea# presents the greatest difficulties to be found in the
phylogeny of the NASSELLARIA, because their morphological relations are
most complicated, and because similar forms very often appear to be of
quite different origin. The great majority of the #Cyrtoidea# show more or
less clearly a combination of the three structural elements: sagittal ring,
basal tripod, and latticed cephalis (p. 891). There are also, however,
numerous #Cyrtoidea#, whose skeleton no longer shows any trace of the
sagittal ring. Many of these show as the basis of the skeleton a strong
basal tripod with an apical spine, around which the cephalis has obviously
been secondarily developed, _e.g._, the remarkable Euscenida (p. 1146, Pls.
53, 97) and the interesting Callimitrida (p. 1217, Pls. 63, 64). These may
have been derived immediately from the #Plectoidea# without any relation to
the #Stephoidea#. There are also numerous true Monocyrtida, whose shell
consists of a simple latticed cephalis without a trace of the sagittal ring
or basal tripod (Cyrtocalpida, Pl. 51, figs. 9-13; Pl. 98, fig. 13); these
may have been developed directly from the skeletonless Nassellida by the
formation of a simple ovoid _Gromia_-like shell, and may have no relation
either to the #Stephoidea# or #Plectoidea#. On these grounds, as well as
from the complicated relationships of the many smaller groups of
#Cyrtoidea#, it is probable that the whole order has been developed
polyphyletically from different divisions of the #Plectellaria#.


191. _Systematic Arrangement of the Cyrtoidea._--Although for the reasons
just given no systematic arrangement of the #Cyrtoidea# can at present, or
for a long time in the future, be regarded as other than artificial, yet
some general principles of classification for this extensive group can be
laid down, which may serve as starting points for some future natural
disposition. This is especially true of the relations which in an
artificial system (p. 1129) were primarily utilised for the distinction of
twelve families and twenty-four subfamilies; the number of segments in the
shell, the number of radial apophyses (and parameres), and the constitution
of the basal aperture of the shell.

  As regards the _number of segments_, separated by transverse
  constrictions, of which the shell is composed, it is dependent upon the
  secondary addition of new joints at the basal pole of the main axis.
  Hence all many-jointed #Cyrtoidea# are to be derived from single-jointed
  ones, and the four sections thus distinguished (Monocyrtida, Dicyrtida,
  Tricyrtida, Stichocyrtida) form a phylogenetic series. Very often,
  however, the primary cephalis disappears owing to retrograde
  metamorphosis; and in such cases the single joint of the apparent
  Monocyrtida is formed of the thorax (_e.g._, {cxxiii}Pls. 52, 54, &c.).
  As regards the _number of radial apophyses_, three sections of
  #Cyrtoidea# may be distinguished;  the Pilocyrtida with three, the
  Astrocyrtida with numerous apophyses, and the Corocyrtida with none (p.
  1129). The last two may in general be regarded as two divergent branches
  from the first, for the eradiate Corocyrtida have probably been formed
  from the triradial Pilocyrtida by entire loss of the radial apophyses,
  whilst on the other hand the multiradiate Astrocyrtida have arisen from
  them by additions to the primary apophyses (interpolation of interradial
  between the perradial ones). As regards the _constitution of the
  shell-aperture_, the #Cyrtoidea# may be divided into Cyrtaperta and
  Cyrtoclausa (p. 1129); in general the Cyrtoclausa (with latticed
  shell-aperture) have arisen from the Cyrtaperta (with simple open mouth);
  in many Monocyrtida the converse may be supposed, the  simple basal mouth
  having been formed by degeneration of a basal lattice.


192. _Phylogeny of the Phæodaria._--The legion PHÆODARIA or CANNOPYLEA is
so clearly marked off from other Radiolaria by the double membrane of the
central capsule and the astropyle at its oral pole, as well as by the
extracapsular phæodium, that it must be regarded phylogenetically as an
independent stem (§ 9). This stem is only connected at its root by
_Phæodina_ with the stem-form of the SPUMELLARIA, _Actissa_. The stem
itself is monophyletic, inasmuch it its members may be derived without
violence from the skeletonless Phæodinida (_Phæodina_, _Phæocolla_). On the
other hand, the formation of the skeleton of the PHÆODARIA is undoubtedly
polyphyletic, different Phæodinida having independently commenced the
formation of a skeleton and having carried it out in very different ways.


193. _Origin of the Phæodaria._--The Phæodinida (p. 1544, Pl. 101), which
may naturally be regarded as the common stem-group of the PHÆODARIA, have
their nearest relations among other Radiolaria in the Thalassicollida (p.
10); and since this family is to be regarded as the primitive group of all
Radiolaria, they may be directly derived from them phylogenetically. The
essential modifications by which the primitive Phæodinida have arisen from
the more archaic Thalassicollida are of three kinds; (1) the doubling of
the membrane of the central capsule; (2) the reduction of the numerous fine
pores in the membrane and the formation of an osculum, and of an astropyle
closing it, at the oral pole of the main axis; (3) the production of an
extracapsular phæodium.  This last may, perhaps, be regarded as a
unilateral hypertrophy of the voluminous pigment masses which are deposited
in the sarcomatrix of certain Thalassicollida. Of the two genera of
Phæodinida hitherto known, probably _Phæodina_ (Pl. 101, fig. 2) approaches
the original stem of the PHÆODARIA more nearly than _Phæocolla_ (Pl. 101,
fig. 1), for the latter exhibits only the large main opening of the central
capsule (astropyle), whilst the former possesses also a pair of accessory
openings (parapylæ). The hypothetical stem-form (_Phæometra_) presumably
had a larger number of small parapylæ (like many Circoporida and
Tuscarorida), and the astropyle was probably but little differentiated from
them.

{cxxv}195. _Phæocystina and Phæocoscina._--Whilst the malacoma of all
PHÆODARIA possesses the characteristics of the legion, and hence justifies
the assumption of a monophyletic origin, the skeleton, on the other hand,
shows in the different groups such manifold and fundamental variations that
a polyphyletic origin of the latter is indubitable. Different Phæodinida
have commenced the formation of the skeleton independently, and it has
progressed in different directions. In the #Phæocystina# it remained
incomplete and led to the formation of various Beloid skeletons, whilst the
#Phæocoscina# developed complete lattice-shells. Both of these divisions
too are to be regarded as polyphyletic, since the skeletal forms of the
different groups cannot be derived without violence from a common primitive
form.


196. _Phæocystina with a Beloid Skeleton._--The order #Phæocystina#
includes all PHÆODARIA which have no complete lattice-shell; it contains,
firstly, the skeletonless Phæodinida (the common stem-group of the legion),
and secondly, the Phæacanthida, or PHÆODARIA with a Beloid skeleton (§
115). The latter are divisible into several very different groups (at least
two or three) which are probably different in origin. The Aulacanthida
(Pls. 102-105) form radial tubes which perforate the calymma, their
proximal end resting upon the surface of the central capsule, whilst the
distal extremity projects freely outwards. The skeleton of the
Cannorrhaphida, on the other hand, is composed of many separate portions
which are never radially arranged but are either placed tangentially to the
surface of the calymma or scattered irregularly in its gelatinous mass.
Furthermore, in the three subfamilies of which this family is composed, the
individual skeletal portions are so different that they have probably
arisen independently of each other; in the Cannobelida they form
cylindrical tangential tubes (Pl. 101, figs. 3-5), in the Catinulida flat
basin or cap-like structures (Pl. 117, fig. 8), in the Dictyochida hollow
rings, from which small pyramids are developed by unilateral formation of
lattice-work (Pl. 101, figs. 9-14; Pl. 114, figs. 7-12).


197. _Phæosphæria with a Sphæroid Skeleton._--The order #Phæosphæria#
includes those PHÆODARIA which possess a spherical (sometimes slightly
modified) lattice-shell without the characteristic aperture of the
#Phæogromia#. They have probably arisen independently of these, though they
may have been derived from the Castanellida by loss of the shell-aperture,
which was present originally. The four families which we have distinguished
among the #Phæosphæria#, are so different in the structure of their
lattice-shell that their phylogenetic connection is doubtful. In the
Orosphærida (Pls. 106, 107) and the Sagosphærida (Pl. 108) the whole
lattice-shell consists of a single piece and is unjointed (without astral
septa); in the former it is very firm and massive, with thick laminated
trabeculæ and polygonal meshes; in the latter it is very delicate and
brittle, with filiform trabeculæ and large {cxxvi}triangular meshes.  On
the other hand, the voluminous shell of the Aulosphærida (Pls. 109-111),
and of the Cannosphærida (Pl. 112), is characterised by a very peculiar
system of joints; it is composed of numerous separate cylindrical tubes,
which are placed tangentially and united at the nodes by stellate
partitions or astral septa. The Cannosphærida possess further a simple
central Cyrtoid shell, connected with the outer jointed shell by hollow
radial trabeculæ. Since many Aulosphærida possess rudiments of such
centripetal trabeculæ it is possible that these latter have been derived
from the former by the loss of the central Cyrtoid shell; the formation of
this monaxon shell perhaps indicates descent from the #Phæogromia#
(Castanellida).


198. _Phæogromia with a Cyrtoid Skeleton._--That order of the PHÆODARIA
which we designate #Phæogromia#, contains many very different forms, all
agreeing in the possession of a Cyrtoid skeleton, or a monaxon
lattice-shell, which has a large aperture at one pole of its vertical main
axis (§ 123). This Cyrtoid skeleton is sometimes ovoid or conical,
sometimes lentiform or helmet-shaped, sometimes polyhedral or almost
spherical. Although the principle of its structure is simple and often like
that of the Monocyrtida among the NASSELLARIA, yet the structure of the
wall and of the apophyses is so different in the various groups of the
#Phæogromia#, that the order is probably polyphyletic, and its Cyrtoid
shells have arisen independently of each other. Only in the Castanellida
(Pl. 113) does the shell-wall usually consist of simple lattice-work; in
the Challengerida, on the other hand (Pl. 99), it has an extremely fine
Diatom-like structure; in the Medusettida (Pls. 118-128) a peculiar
alveolar structure, and in the Circoporida (Pls. 114-117) and Tuscarorida
(Pl. 100) it possesses a characteristic porcellanous constitution (with
tangential spicules in a porous cement-mass); in the latter of these groups
the surface is smooth, in the former peculiarly tabulate; the two families
have also different stem-forms.


199. _Phæoconchia with a Conchoid Shell._--The order #Phæoconchia# (Pls.
121-128) is separated not only from all other PHÆODARIA, but also from all
other Radiolaria, by the possession of a bivalved shell resembling that of
a Lamellibranch; the two valves of this Conchoid skeleton are to be
interpreted as dorsal and ventral (§ 128). Probably these bivalved shells
are independent products, but possibly they may have been formed by the
bisection of a simple spherical lattice-shell; in the former case the
#Phæoconchia# would be directly descended from the Phæodinida, in the
latter from the Castanellida. The three families which we have
distinguished among the #Phæoconchia#, probably constitute a connected
stem, the most primitive group of which are the Concharida (Pls. 123-125).
From these the Coelodendrida (Pls. 121, 122) have next arisen by the
formation of a "galea" upon the apex of each valve, and the growth of
hollow tubes from this helmet-like structure. Finally, the Coelographida
{cxxvii}(Pls. 120-128) have been developed from the Coelodendrida by the
formation of a basal nasal tube (rhinocanna) from each galea, and the
formation of a median or paired frenulum, which connects the opening of the
nasal tube with the apex of the galea. In the Coelodendrida, as well as in
the Coelographida, there are two different subfamilies, of which the more
primitive (Coelodorida, Coelotholida) have free branches from the hollow
radial tubes, whilst the more recent (Coelodrymida, Coeloplegmida) form an
outer bivalved shell by anastomosis of the branches of the tubes.


200. _The Fundamental Biogenetic Law._--The causal connection between
ontogeny and phylogeny, which finds its most precise statement in the
fundamental biogenetic law, holds in general for the Radiolaria as for all
other organisms. In order to furnish direct proof of this, however, a
complete empirical knowledge both of individual and of palæontological
development would be necessary. In both these directions, as has been shown
in the foregoing chapters, our knowledge of the Radiolaria is very
incomplete and fragmentary, but still we are able to convince ourselves
indirectly of the validity of the law as applied to Radiolaria by the aid
of comparative anatomy. This is now so fully known to us (§§ 1-140) that we
are able not only to draw a complete and satisfactory picture of their
morphology, but also to arrive at most important conclusions regarding the
ontogeny and phylogeny of the individual groups. As regards the formation
of the multiform skeleton of the Radiolaria, most of the ontogenetic series
of forms, with which we have become acquainted by comparative anatomy, are
of _palingenetic_ nature; that is, they are primarily due to inheritance
and thus of direct phylogenetic significance. On the other hand, among the
ontogenetic phenomena of the Radiolaria, as far as they have yet been
investigated, only very few are _cenogenetic_, that is, brought about by
adaptive modification and without direct significance as regards phylogeny.

CHAPTER VII.--VEGETATIVE FUNCTIONS.

(§§ 201-217.)

201. _Mechanism of the Functions._--The vital phenomena of the Radiolaria
are dependent upon the mechanical functions of their unicellular body, and
like those of all other organisms, are to be referred to physical and
chemical natural laws. All processes which appear in the life of the
Radiolaria are, therefore, ultimately to be explained by the attraction and
repulsion of the smallest particles, which compose the different portions
of their unicellular body; and the sensation of pleasure or the opposite is
in its turn the exciting cause of these elementary movements. Many adaptive
arrangements in the Radiolarian organism may produce the appearance of
being the premeditated result of causes working towards an end
("zweckthätig," _causæ finales_), but as opposed to this deceptive
appearance it must here be expressly stated that these may be recognised in
accordance with the developmental theory as the necessary consequence of
mechanical causes (_causæ efficientes_).

  Our _physiological_ acquaintance with the Radiolaria has by no means
  progressed so far as our _morphological_, so that the incomplete
  communications which are placed here for the sake of completeness must be
  regarded merely as preliminary fragments, not as fully elaborated
  results. Since my recent investigations have been mainly in the direction
  of morphology, I can add but little to the physiological conclusions,
  which I stated at length in my monograph twenty-four years ago (L. N. 16,
  pp. 127-165). Recently the vegetative physiology of the Radiolaria has
  been much advanced by the recognition of the symbiosis with the Xanthellæ
  (§ 205, L. N. 22, 39, 42). In addition Karl Brandt has recently (1885)
  published several important contributions to the physiology of the
  Polycyttaria or Sphaerozoea (L. N. 52).


202. _Distribution of Functions._--The distribution of the functions among
the various parts of the unicellular organism of the Radiolaria corresponds
directly to their anatomical composition, so that physiologically as well
as morphologically the central capsule and the extracapsulum appear as the
two coordinated main components. On the one hand the _central capsule_ with
its endoplasm and enclosed nucleus is the central organ of the "cell-soul"
(Zellseele), the unit regulating its animal and vegetative functions, and
the special organ of reproduction and inheritance. The _extracapsulum_
forms, on the other hand, by its calymma the protective envelope of the
central {cxxix}capsule, the support of the soft pseudopodia and the
substratum of the skeleton; the calymma acts also as a hydrostatic
apparatus, whilst the radiating pseudopodia are of the greatest importance
both as organs of nutrition and adaptation, as well as of motion and
sensation (§ 15). If, however, the vital functions as a whole be divided in
accordance with the usual convention into the two great groups of
_vegetative_ (nutrition and reproduction) and _animal_ (motion and
sensation), then the central capsule would be mainly the organ of
reproduction and sensation, and the extracapsulum the organ of nutrition
and motion.

  The numerous separate vital phenomena, which by accurate physiological
  investigation may be distinguished in the unicellular Radiolarian
  organism, may be distributed in the above indicated conventional fashion
  into a few larger and several smaller groups; it must always be borne in
  mind, however, that these overlap in many respects, and that the division
  of labour among the different organs in these Protista is somewhat
  complicated, notwithstanding the apparent simplicity of their unicellular
  organization. A general classification of the groups of functions is
  difficult, because each individual organ discharges several different
  functions. Thus the central capsule is pre-eminently the organ of
  reproduction and inheritance, but not less (though less conspicuous) is
  its importance as the psychical central organ, the unit regulating the
  processes of sensation, motion, and also nutrition. In this last respect
  it is comparable to the nerve-centres of the Metazoa, whilst the
  peripheral nervous system of the latter (including the organs of sense
  and the muscles) are in the present instance represented by the
  pseudopodia, which are at the same time the most important organs of
  nutrition and adaptation. In the calymma also in similar fashion several
  different physiological functions are united.


203. _Metastasis._--The functions of metastasis and nutrition have in all
Radiolaria a purely animal character, so that these Rhizopoda from the
physiological standpoint are to be regarded as truly _unicellular animals_,
or Protozoa ("Urthiere"). Since they do not possess, like plants, the power
of forming synthetically the compounds (protoplasm, carbohydrates, &c.)
necessary for their sustenance, they are compelled to obtain them
ready-formed from other organisms. Like other true animals they evolve
carbon dioxide by the partial oxidation of those products, and hence they
successively take up the oxygen necessary to their existence from their
environment.

  The question whether the Radiolaria are to be regarded as true animals I
  discussed fully from various points of view in 1862, and finally answered
  in the affirmative (L. N. 16, pp. 159-165). Afterwards, when in my
  Generelle Morphologie (1866) I sought to establish the kingdom Protista,
  I removed the Radiolaria along with the other Rhizopoda from the animal
  kingdom proper and placed them in the kingdom Protista (Bd. i. pp.
  215-220; Bd. ii. p. xxix). Compare also my Protistenreich (L. N. 32) and
  my Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte (vii. Aufl., 1879, p. 364). Both these
  steps appear fully justified when considered in the light of our present
  increased knowledge. From the _physiological_ standpoint the Radiolaria
  appear as unicellular _animals_, for in this respect the animal character
  of their metastasis (that proper to an oxidising organism) furnishes the
  sole {cxxx}criterion. On the other hand, from the morphological
  standpoint, they are to be classed as neutral Protista, for in this
  respect their unicellular character is the prominent feature, and
  distinguishes them from all true multicellular animals (Metazoa). Compare
  my Gastræa Theorie (1873, Jena. Zeitschr. für Naturwiss., Bd. viii. pp.
  29, 53).


204. _Nutrition._--The nutritive materials which the Radiolaria require for
their sustenance, especially albuminates (plasma) and carbohydrates
(starch, &c.), they obtain partly from foreign organisms which they capture
and digest, and partly directly from the Xanthellæ or Philozoa, the
unicellular Algæ, with which they live in symbiosis (§ 205). _Zooxanthella
intracapsularis_, found in the ACANTHARIA (§ 76), is probably of the same
significance in this respect as _Zooxanthella extracapsularis_ of the
SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA (§ 90); and perhaps the same is true also of
_Phæodella extracapsularis_ (or _Zoochlorella phæodaris_?) of the PHÆODARIA
(§ 89). The considerable quantity of starch or amyloid bodies, elaborated
by these inquiline symbiontes, as well as their protoplasm and nucleus, are
available, on their death, for the nutrition of the Radiolaria which
harbour them. Nutrition by means of other particles obtained by the
pseudopodia from the surrounding medium is by no means excluded; indeed it
may be regarded as certain that numerous Radiolaria (especially such as
contain no symbiotic Algoid cells) are nourished for the most part or
exclusively by this means. Diatoms, Infusoria, Thalamophora (Foraminifera)
as well as decaying particles of animal and vegetable tissues can be seized
directly by the pseudopodia and conveyed either to the sarcodictyum (on the
surface of the calymma) or to the sarcomatrix (on the surface of the
central capsule) in order to undergo digestion there. The indigestible
constituents (siliceous shells of Diatoms and Tintinnoidea, calcareous
shells of small Monothalamia and Polythalamia, &c.) are here collected
often in large numbers and removed by the streaming of the protoplasm.

  The inception and digestion of nutriment, as it usually appears to take
  place by the pseudopodia, has already been so fully treated in my
  Monograph (L. N. 16, pp. 135-140), and since then in my paper on the
  sarcode body of the Rhizopoda (L. N. 19, p. 342), that I have nothing of
  importance to add. Quite recently Karl Brandt has expressed a doubt as to
  whether the taking up of formed particles by the pseudopodia and their
  aggregation in the calymma be really connected with the process of
  nutrition. He is disposed rather to believe that these foreign bodies are
  usually only accidentally and mechanically brought into the calymma, and
  that the nourishment of the Radiolaria is derived exclusively or
  pre-eminently from the symbiotic Xanthellæ (L. N. 52, pp. 88-93). I must,
  however, maintain my former opinion, which I have only modified insomuch
  that I now regard the sarcodictyum (on the outer surface of the calymma,
  § 94) rather than the sarcomatrix (on the outer surface of the central
  capsule, § 92) as the principal seat of true digestion and assimilation.
  From the sarcodictyum the dissolved and assimilated nutritive matters may
  pass by the intracalymmar pseudopodia (or sarcoplegma, § 93) into the
  sarcomatrix, and hence may reach the endoplasm through the openings in
  the central capsule. To what an extent the Radiolaria are capable of
  taking up even large formed bodies into the calymma, is shown by the
  {cxxxi}striking instance of _Thalassicolla sanguinolenta_, which becomes
  so deformed by the inception of numerous coccospheres and coccoliths,
  that I described it as a special genus under the name _Myxobrachia_
  (compare pp. 23, 30; also L. N. 21, p. 519, Taf. xviii., and L. N. 33, p.
  37).


205. _Symbiosis._--Very many Radiolaria, but by no means all members of
this class, live in a definite commensal relation with yellow unicellular
Algæ of the group Xanthellæ. In the ACANTHARIA they live within the central
capsule (_Zooxanthella intracapsularis_, § 76), in the SPUMELLARIA and
NASSELLARIA, on the other hand, within the calymma but outside the central
capsule (_Zooxanthella extracapsularis_, § 90); in the PHÆODARIA a special
form of these symbiotic unicellular Algæ appears to inhabit the phæodium in
the extracapsulum, and to compose a considerable portion of the phæodellæ
(_Zooxanthella phæodaris_, § 90, or better perhaps _Zoochlorella
phæodaris_, § 89). Undoubtedly this commensal life is in very many cases of
the greatest physiological significance for both the symbiontes, for the
animal Radiolarian cells furnish the inquiline Xanthellæ not only with
shelter and protection, but also with carbon dioxide and other products of
decomposition for their nutriment; whilst on the other hand the vegetable
cells of the Xanthellæ yield the Radiolarian host its most important supply
of nutriment, protoplasm and starch, as well as oxygen for respiration.
Hence it is not only theoretically possible, but has been experimentally
proved, that Radiolaria which contain numerous Xanthellæ can exist without
extraneous nutriment for a long period in closed vessels of filtered
sea-water, kept exposed to the sunlight; the two symbiontes furnish each
other mutually with nourishment, and are physiologically supplementary to
each other by reason of the opposite nature of their metastasis. This
symbiosis is not necessary, however, for the existence of the Radiolaria;
for in many species the number of Xanthellæ is very variable and in many
others they are entirely wanting.

  The symbiosis of the Radiolaria and Xanthellæ, or "yellow cells" (§§ 76,
  90) was first discovered by Cienkowski in 1871 (L. N. 22). Ten years
  later this important and often doubted fact was established by extended
  observations and experiments almost simultaneously by Karl Brandt (L. N.
  38, 39) and Patrick Geddes (L. N. 42, 43). This commensal life may be
  compared with that of the lichens, in which an organism with vegetable
  metastasis (the Algoid gonidia) and an organism with animal metastasis
  (the Fungoid hyphæ) are intimately united for mutual benefit. But the
  symbiosis of the Xanthellæ and Radiolaria is not as in the lichens a
  phenomenon essential for their development, but has more or less the
  character of an accidental association. The number of the inquiline
  Xanthellæ is so variable even in one and the same species of Radiolaria,
  that they do not appear to be exactly essential to its welfare; and in
  many species they are entirely wanting. Their significance is
  questionable in the case of those numerous deep-sea Radiolaria which live
  in complete darkness, and in which, therefore, the Xanthellæ, even if
  present, could excrete no oxygen on account of the want of light.
  Nevertheless it is possible that the phæodellæ of the PHÆODARIA (usually
  green, olive, or brown in colour), which are true cells, represent
  vegetable symbiontes, {cxxxii}which in the absence of sunlight are able
  to evolve oxygen by the aid of the phosphoresence of other abyssal
  animals. Since the PHÆODARIA are, for the most part, dwellers in the
  deep-sea, and since the voluminous phæodium must be of great
  physiological importance, a positive solution of this hypothetical
  question would be of no small interest (compare § 89).


206. _Respiration._--The respiration of the Radiolaria is animal in nature,
since all Protista of this class, like all other true Rhizopoda, take in
oxygen and give off carbon dioxide. Probably this process goes on
continuously and is tolerably active, as may be inferred from the fact that
Radiolaria cannot be kept for long in small vessels of sea-water unless
either they contain numerous Xanthellæ or the water is well aërated. The
oxygen is obtained from two sources, either from the surrounding water or
from the enclosed Xanthellæ, which in sunlight evolve considerable
quantities of this gas. Correspondingly, the carbon dioxide which is formed
during the process of oxidation of the Radiolaria is either given up to the
surrounding water or to the inquiline Xanthellæ, which utilise it for their
own sustenance (§§ 204, 205).

  The significance of the symbiotic Xanthellæ for the respiration of the
  enclosing Radiolaria may be shown experimentally in the following way. If
  two Polycyttarian colonies of equal size, both of which contain numerous
  Xanthellæ, be placed in equal quantities of filtered sea-water in sealed
  glass tubes, and if one tube be placed in the dark the other in the
  light, the colony in the former rapidly perishes, but not that in the
  latter; the Xanthellæ excrete only under the influence of sunlight the
  oxygen necessary for the life of the Radiolarian (compare Patrick Geddes,
  L. N. 42, p. 304).


207. _Circulation._--In the protoplasm of all Radiolaria, both inside and
outside the central capsule, slow currents may be recognised which fall
under the general term circulation, and have already been compared to the
cyclosis in the interior of animal and vegetable cells, as well as to the
sarcode streams in the body of other Rhizopoda. These plasmatic currents or
"plasmorrheumata" probably continue throughout the whole life of the
Radiolaria, and are of fundamental importance for the performance of their
vital functions. They depend upon slow displacements of the molecules of
the plasma (plastidules or micellæ) and cause a uniform distribution of the
absorbed nutriment and a certain equalisation of the metastasis.
Furthermore they are of great importance also in the inception of
nutriment, the formation of the skeleton, locomotion, &c. Sometimes the
circulation is directly perceptible in the plasma itself; but usually it is
only visible owing to the presence of granules (sarcogranula), which are
suspended in the plasma in larger or smaller numbers. The movements of
these granules are usually regarded as passive, due to the active
displacement of the molecules of the plasma. Although the intracapsular
protoplasm is in communication with the extracapsular through the openings
in the capsule membrane, nevertheless the currents exhibit certain
differences {cxxxiii}in the two portions of the malacoma. It is sometimes
possible, however, to recognise the direct connection between them and to
observe how the granules pass through the openings in the capsule-membrane.


208. _Currents in the Endoplasm._--Intracapsular circulation or a certain
slow flowing of the plasma within the central capsule is probably just as
common in the Radiolaria as without it, but it is not so easy to observe in
the former case as in the latter. A more satisfactory proof of these
endoplasmatic currents is furnished by the arrangement of the protoplasm
within the central capsule, since this is (at all events in part) an effect
produced by them. In this respect the two main divisions of the class show
characteristic differences. In the Porulosa (the SPUMELLARIA, § 77, and the
ACANTHARIA, § 78) the endoplasm is in general distinguished by a more or
less distinct radial structure, which is to be regarded as the effect of
alternating centripetal and centrifugal radial streams. In the Osculosa, on
the other hand, this radial structure is absent and the intracapsular
plasmatic streams converge or diverge towards the osculum or main-opening
in the central capsule which lies at the basal pole of its main axis, and
through which the mass of the endoplasm issues into the calymma. The two
legions of the Osculosa, however, present differences in this respect. In
the NASSELLARIA (§ 79) the endoplasmatic currents appear to unite in an
axial main stream at the apex of the monaxon central capsule, and this
apical stream seems to split into a conical bundle, the individual threads
of which pass diverging between the myophane fibrillæ of the podoconus
towards the basis of the central capsule, and issue through the pores of
the porochora. In the PHÆODARIA (§ 80), on the other hand, meridional
currents of endoplasm are probably present on the inner surface of the
capsule, which flow from the aboral pole of the vertical main axis to its
basal pole, and return in the reverse direction.


209. _Currents in the Exoplasm._--Extracapsular circulation, or a distinct
flowing of the plasma outside the central capsule, may be readily observed
in all Radiolaria which are examined alive; this is most readily seen in
the astropodia, or those free pseudopodia which radiate from the
sarcodictyum on the surface of the calymma into the surrounding water. The
granular movement is often quite as clear in the sarcodictyum itself, and
may be recognised in the collopodia, which compose the irregular plasmatic
network within the calymma. More rarely it is possible to follow the
granular stream thence through the sarcomatrix, and further into the
interior of the central capsule. In general the direction of the
extracapsular protoplasmic streams is radial, and it is frequently
possible, even in a single free astropodium, to observe two streams
opposite in direction, the granules on one side of the radial sarcode
thread moving centripetally, those on the other side centrifugally. If the
threads branch, and neighbouring ones {cxxxiv}become united by connecting
threads, the circulation of the granules may proceed quite irregularly in
the network thus formed. The rapidity and character of the extracapsular
currents are subject to great variations.

  The different forms of extracapsular sarcode currents have been already
  very fully described in my Monograph (L. N. 16, pp. 89-126), and in my
  critical essay on the sarcode body of the Rhizopoda (L. N. 19, p. 357,
  Taf. XXVI.).


210. _Secretion._--Under the name _secretions_, in the strict sense, all
the skeletal formations of the Radiolaria may be included. They may be
divided according to their chemical composition into three different
groups: pure silica in the SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, a silicate of
carbon in the PHÆODARIA, and acanthin in the ACANTHARIA (compare § 102). It
may indeed be assumed that these skeletons arise directly by a chemical
metamorphosis (silicification, acanthinosis, &c.) of the pseudopodia and
protoplasmic network; and this view seems especially justified in the case
of the Astroid skeleton of the ACANTHARIA (§ 114), the Spongoid skeleton of
the SPUMELLARIA (§ 126), the Plectoid skeleton of the NASSELLARIA (§ 125),
the Cannoid skeleton of the PHÆODARIA (§ 127), and several other types. On
closer investigation, however, it appears yet more probable that the
skeleton does not arise by direct chemical metamorphosis of the protoplasm,
but by secretion from it; for when the dissolved skeletal material (silica,
acanthin) passes from the fluid into the solid state, it does not appear as
imbedded in the plasma, but as deposited from it. However, it must be borne
in mind that a hard line of demarcation can scarcely, if at all, be drawn
between these two processes. In the ACANTHARIA the intracapsular sarcode is
the original organ of secretion of the skeleton; in the other three
legions, on the other hand, the extracapsulum performs this function (§§
106, 107). In addition to the skeleton, we may regard as secretions (or
excretions) the intracapsular crystals (§ 75) and concretions (§ 75A), and
perhaps certain pigment-bodies (§§ 74, 88); and further, the calymma (§ 82)
may be considered to be a gelatinous secretion of the central capsule, and
perhaps also the capsule-membrane, in so far as it represents only a
secondary excretory product of the unicellular organism.


211. _Adaptation._--The innumerable and very various adaptive phenomena
which we meet with in the morphology of the Radiolaria, and especially in
that of their skeleton, are like other phenomena of the same kind, to be
ultimately referred to altered nutritional relations. These may be caused
directly either by the influence of external conditions of existence
(nutrition, light, temperature, &c.), or by the proper activity of the
unicellular organism (use or disuse of its organs, &c.), or, finally, by
the combined action of both causes in the struggle for existence. In very
many cases the cause to which the origin of a particular form of Radiolaria
is due may be directly perceived or at least guessed at with considerable
probability; thus, for example, the lattice-shells {cxxxv}may be explained
as protective coverings, the radial spines as defensive weapons, and the
anchor-hooks and spathillæ as organs of prehension, which are of advantage
to their possessors in the struggle for existence; the regular arrangement
of the radial spines in the Radiolaria may also be explained on hydrostatic
grounds, it being advantageous that the body should be maintained in a
definite position of equilibrium, &c. The well-known laws of _direct_ or
_actual adaptation_, which we designate cumulative, correlative, divergent
adaptation, &c., here explain a multitude of morphological phenomena. The
connection is less distinct in the case of the laws of _indirect_ or
_potential adaptation_, although this must play as important a part in the
formation of the Radiolaria as in that of other organisms (compare on this
head my Generelle Morphologie, Bd. ii. pp. 202-222).


212. _Reproduction._--The most common form of reproduction in the
Radiolaria is the formation of spores in the central capsule, which in this
respect is to be regarded as a sporangium (§ 215). In many Radiolaria
(Polycyttaria and PHÆODARIA), however, there occurs in addition an increase
of the unicellular organism by simple division (§ 213); upon this the
formation of colonies in the social Radiolaria is dependent (§ 14).
Reproduction by gemmation is much less common, and has hitherto been
observed only in the Polycyttaria (§ 214). In this group alone there also
occur at certain times two different forms of swarm-spores which copulate,
and thus indicate the commencement of sexual reproduction (Alternation of
Generations, § 216). The general organ of reproduction is in all cases the
central capsule, whilst the extracapsulum never takes an active part in the
process.


213. _Cell-Division._--Increase by cell-division among the Radiolaria in
the early stage, before the formation of the skeleton, is widely
distributed (perhaps even general?); in the adults of this class it is
rather rare and limited to certain groups. It is most readily observed in
the Polycyttaria; the growth of the colonies in this social group depends
mainly (and in many species exclusively) upon repeated spontaneous division
of the central capsule; all the individuals of each colony (in so far as
this has not arisen by the accidental fusion of two or more colonies) are
descendants of a single central capsule, which has arisen from an asexual
swarm-spore (§ 215) or from the copulation of two sexual swarm-spores (§
216). Whilst the central capsules of the colonies continually increase by
division, their calymma remains a common gelatinous sheath. Among the
SPUMELLARIA reproduction by simple cell-division probably occurs also in
many monozootic #Collodaria#. Among the ACANTHARIA the peculiar group
Litholophida has perhaps arisen by the spontaneous division of
#Acanthonida# (see p. 734). Among the PHÆODARIA increase by cell-division
seems to occur commonly in many groups, as in the #Phæocystina#, which have
no skeleton (Phæodinida, Pl. 101, {cxxxvi}fig. 2), or only an incomplete
Beloid skeleton (Cannorrhaphida, Pl. 101, figs. 3, 6, and Aulacanthida, Pl.
104, figs. 1-3). The #Phæosphæria# also (Aulosphærida, Coelacanthida) and
the #Phæogromia# (Tuscarorida, Challengerida) appear sometimes to divide;
at all events, their central capsule often contains two nuclei. Of special
interest  is the spontaneous division of the #Phæoconchia#, especially the
Concharida (Pl. 124, fig. 6). In all monozootic Radiolaria, the nucleus
first divides by a median constriction into two equal halves (usually by
the mode of direct division); then the central capsule becomes constricted
in the middle (in the PHÆODARIA in the vertical main axis), and each
portion of the capsule retains its own nucleus. In the #Phæoconchia# each
half or daughter-cell corresponds to one valve of the shell, dorsal or
ventral, so that probably on subsequent separation each daughter-cell
retains one valve of the mother-cell, and forms a new one for itself by
regeneration (as in the Diatoms). In the polyzootic Radiolaria, which
already contain many small nuclei, but usually only a single central
oil-globule in each central capsule, the division of the latter is preceded
by that of the oil-globule. In many Polycyttaria the colony as a whole
multiplies by division.

  The increase of the central capsule by division was first described in
  1862 in my Monograph (L. N. 16, p. 146); since then R. Hertwig (L. N. 26,
  p. 24) and K. Brandt (L. N. 52, p. 144) have confirmed my statement. In
  the PHÆODARIA the division of the central capsule appears always to take
  place in the main axis; in the bilateral sometimes in the sagittal,
  sometimes in the frontal plane. In the Tripylea each daughter-cell seems
  to retain one parapyle and half the astropyle (compare the general
  description of the PHÆODARIA, Pl. 101, figs. 1-6, Pl. 104, figs. 1-3, and
  also Hertwig, L. N. 33, p. 100, Taf. x. figs. 2, 11). Regarding the
  spontaneous division of colonies of the Polycyttaria, see K. Brandt, L.
  N. 52, p. 142.


214. _Cell-Gemmation._--Reproduction by gemmation has hitherto been
observed only in the social Radiolaria, but in them it appears to be widely
distributed, and in very young colonies is perhaps almost universally
present. The gemmules or capsular buds (hitherto described as
"extracapsular bodies") are developed on the surface of young central
capsules before these had secreted a membrane. They grow usually in
considerable numbers, from the surface of the central capsule, which is
sometimes quite covered with them. Each bud usually contains a
raspberry-like bunch of shining fatty globules, and by means of reagents a
few larger or a considerable number of smaller nuclei may be recognised in
them; the naked protoplasmic body of the bud is not enclosed by any
membrane. As soon as the buds have reached a certain size they are
constricted off from the central capsule and separated from it, being
distributed in the meshes of the sarcoplegma by the currents in the
exoplasm. Afterwards each bud becomes developed into a complete central
capsule by surrounding itself with a membrane when it has attained a
definite size. From the special relations of the process of nuclear
formation, which take place in the multiplication of the {cxxxvii}social
central capsules by gemmation and by cell-division, it would appear that
the capsules produced by the former method afterwards produce anisospores,
whilst those in the latter way yield isospores (§ 216).

  The gemmules or capsular buds of the Polycyttaria were first accurately
  described by Richard Hertwig (L. N. 26, pp. 37-39), under the name
  "extracapsular bodies," and their significance rightly indicated; earlier
  observers had incidentally mentioned and figured them, but had not seen
  their origin from the central capsule. Quite recently Karl Brandt has
  given a very painstaking account of them in the different Polycyttarian
  genera (L. N. 52, pp. 179-198). In the Monocyttaria such a formation of
  buds has not yet been observed. The basal lobes of the central capsule,
  which occur in many NASSELLARIA, are not buds, but simple processes of
  the capsule, due to its protrusion through the collar pores of the
  cortinar septum (§ 55).


215. _Sporification._--Asexual reproduction by the formation of movable
flagellate spores has been hitherto observed only in a very small number of
genera; but since these belong to very different groups, and since the
comparative morphology of the capsule appears to be similar throughout as
regards the structure and development of its contents, it may be safely
assumed that this kind of reproduction occurs quite generally in the
Radiolaria. In all cases it is the contents of the central capsule, from
which the swarm-spores are formed, both nucleus and endoplasm taking an
equal share in the process; in all cases the spores produced are very
numerous, small, ovoid or reniform, and have one or two very long slender
flagella at one extremity (see §§ 141, 142). Since the whole contents of
the mature central capsule are used up in the formation of these flagellate
zoospores, it discharges the function of a sporangium. The division of the
simple primary nucleus into numerous small nuclei, which usually
(serotinous Radiolaria) takes place only shortly before sporification, but
sometimes (precocious Radiolaria, § 63) happens very early, is the
commencement of the often repeated process of nuclear division, which
terminates with the production of a very large number of small
spore-nuclei. The nucleolus often divides very peculiarly (§ 69, C). Each
spore nucleus becomes surrounded by a portion of endoplasm and usually
receives in addition one or more fatty granules, and sometimes also a small
crystal (hence the "crystal-spores"). The size of the flagellate zoospores
which emerge from the ruptured central capsule and swim freely in the water
by means of their flagellum, varies generally between 0.004 and 0.008 mm.
The extracapsulum is not directly concerned in the sporification, but
undergoes degeneration during the process and perishes at its conclusion.

  The first complete and detailed observations on the formation of spores
  in the Radiolaria were published by Cienkowski in 1871 and related to two
  genera of Polycyttaria, the skeletonless _Collozoum_ and the
  spherical-shelled _Collosphæra_ (L. N. 22, p. 372, Taf. xxix.). These
  were subsequently continued and supplemented by R. Hertwig (1876, L. N.
  26, pp. 26-42, and L. N. 33, p. 129), and a general summary of these
  results has been given by Bütschli (L. N. 41, pp. 449-455).
  {cxxxviii}Recently Karl Brandt has given a very detailed and fully
  illustrated account of the sporification of the Polycyttaria (L. N. 52,
  pp. 145-178). I have also had the opportunity during my sojourn in the
  Canary Islands (1866), in the Mediterranean at Corfu (1877), and
  Portofino (1880), as well as in Ceylon (1881), of observing the
  development of flagellate zoospores from the central capsule of
  individuals of all four legions: among the SPUMELLARIA in certain
  #Colloidea#, #Beloidea#, #Sphæroidea#, and #Discoidea#, among the
  ACANTHARIA in several #Acanthometra# and #Acanthophracta#, among the
  NASSELLARIA in individuals belonging to the #Stephoidea#, #Plectoidea#,
  and #Cyrtoidea#, and among the PHÆODARIA in one Castanellid. In most
  zoospores I could distinctly observe only a single long flagellum;
  sometimes, however, two or even three appeared to be present, but the
  determination of their number is very difficult.


216. _Alternation of Generations._--A peculiar form of reproduction, which
may be designated "alternation of generations," appears to occur generally
in the Polycyttaria, but has not yet been observed in the Monocyttaria. All
#Collozoida#, #Sphærozoida#, and Collosphærida which have hitherto been
carefully and completely examined with respect to their development, are
distinguished by the production of two different kinds of swarm-spores,
isospores and anisospores. The _Isospores_ (or monogonous spores)
correspond to the ordinary asexual zoospores of the Monocyttaria (§ 215);
they possess a homogeneous, doubly refracting nucleus of uniform
constitution and develop asexually, without copulation. The _Anisospores_
(or amphigonous spores), on the other hand, are sexually differentiated and
possess a heterogeneous, singly refracting nucleus of twofold constitution;
they may therefore be distinguished as female macrospores and male
microspores. The _Macrospores_ (or gynospores, comparable with the female
macrogonidia of many Cryptogams) are larger, less numerous, and possess
larger nuclei, which are less easily stained, and have a fine filiform
trabecular network. On the other hand the _Microspores_ (or _androspores_,
comparable with the male microgonidia) are much smaller and more numerous,
and are distinguished by their smaller nuclei, which have thicker tuberculæ
and become stained more intensely. The gynospores and androspores are
developed in the #Collozoida# and #Sphærozoida# in the same individual, but
not in the Collosphærida. It is very probable that these two forms of
anisospores copulate with each other after their exit from the central
capsule and thus produce a new cell by the simplest mode of sexual
reproduction. But, since the same Polycyttaria, which produce these
anisospores, at other times give rise to ordinary or asexual isospores, it
is further possible that these two forms of reproduction alternate with
each other, and that the Polycyttaria thus pass through a true alternation
of generations. This has not yet been observed in the Monocyttaria, and
hence these latter seem to bear to the Polycyttaria a relation similar to
that in which the sexless solitary Flagellata (Astasiea) stand to the
sexual social Flagellata (Volvocinea). In the two analogous cases the
sexual differentiation may be regarded as a consequence of the social life
in the gelatinous colonies.

  {cxxxix}The _sexual differentiation of the Polycyttaria_ was first
  discovered in 1875 by R. Hertwig, and accurately described in the case of
  _Collozoum inerme_ as occurring in addition to the formation of the
  ordinary crystal-spores (L. N. 26, p. 36); compare also the general
  discussion of Bütschli (L. N. 41, p. 52). Recently Karl Brandt has
  demonstrated the formation of both homogeneous isospores (crystal-spores)
  and heterogeneous anisospores (macro- and microspores) in seven different
  species of Polycyttaria, and has come to the conclusion that in all
  social Radiolaria there is a regular alternation between the former and
  latter generations. Compare his elaborate account of the colonial
  Radiolaria of the Gulf of Naples (L. N. 52, pp. 145-178).


217. _Inheritance._--Inheritance is to be regarded as the most important
accompaniment to the function of reproduction, and especially in the
present case, because the comparative morphology of the Radiolaria
furnishes abundant instances of the action of its different laws. The laws
of _conservative inheritance_ are illustrated by the comparative anatomy of
the larger groups; thus, in the four legions the characteristic
peculiarities of the central capsule are maintained unaltered in
consequence of continuous inheritance, although great varieties appear in
the skeleton in each legion. The individual parts of the skeleton furnish
by their development on the one hand and their degeneration on the other,
especially in the smaller groups, examples of _progressive inheritance_.
Thus in the SPUMELLARIA the constant formation of the primary lattice-shell
(a central medullary shell) and its ontogenetic relation to the secondary
one, which is developed concentrically round it, can only be explained
phylogenetically by conservative inheritance, whilst on the other hand the
characteristic differentiation of the axes in the various families of
SPUMELLARIA is to be explained by progressive inheritance. In the
ACANTHARIA the arrangement of the twenty radial spines (in accordance with
Müller's law, §§ 110, 172) was first acquired by a group of the most
archaic #Actinelida# (Adelacantha) through hydrostatic adaptation, and has
since been transmitted by inheritance to all the other families of the
legion (Icosacantha). The morphology of the NASSELLARIA is not less
interesting, because here several different heritable elements (the primary
sagittal ring and the basal tripod) combine in the most manifold ways in
the formation of the skeleton (compare §§ 123, 124, 182). The affinities of
the genera in the different families yield an astonishing variety of
interesting morphological phenomena, which can only be explained by
progressive inheritance. The same is true also of the PHÆODARIA. In this
legion the primary inheritance is especially manifested in the constant and
firm structure of the central capsule with its characteristic double wall
and astropyle, whilst the formation of the skeleton in this legion proceeds
in different directions by means of divergent adaptation. The morphology of
the Radiolaria thus proves itself a rich source of materials for the
physiological study of adaptation and inheritance.



{cxl}CHAPTER VIII.--ANIMAL FUNCTIONS.

(§§ 218-225.)

218. _Motion._--In addition to the internal movements which appear
generally in the unicellular Radiolaria and have already been mentioned as
plasmatic currents in treating of the circulation (§§ 207-209), two
different groups of external motor phenomena are to be observed in this
class: first, the _contraction_ of individual parts, which brings about
modifications of form (§ 220), and secondly, voluntary or reflex
_locomotion_ of the whole body (§ 220). These movements are partly due to
changes in form of undifferentiated plasmatic threads or sarcode filaments,
partly to the actual contraction of differentiated filaments which are
comparable to muscle fibrillæ, and must therefore be distinguished as
myophanes. In addition to this, endosmose and exosmose probably play an
important part in some of the locomotive phenomena, but nothing is yet
certainly known regarding these osmotic processes. We are at present
equally ignorant whether all the movements of the Radiolaria are simply
reflex (direct consequences of irritation) or whether they are in part
truly spontaneous.


219. _Suspension._--From direct observation of living Radiolaria, as well
as from deductive reasoning, based upon their morphology (and especially
their promorphology, §§ 17-50), the conclusion appears justified that all
Protista of this class in their normal condition float suspended in the
sea-water, either at the surface or at a definite depth. A necessary
condition of this hydrostatic suspension is that the specific gravity of
the Radiolarian organism must be equal to, or but slightly greater than
that of sea-water. The increase in specific gravity brought about by the
production of the siliceous skeleton, is compensated by the lighter fatty
globules, and partly perhaps by the calymma, especially when the latter
contains vacuoles or alveoles. The fluid or jelly contained in the latter
appears to be for the most part lighter than sea-water (containing no salt,
or only a very small quantity?). But if the specific gravity of the whole
body should be generally (or perhaps always) slightly greater than that of
sea-water, then the organism would be prevented from sinking, partly by the
increased friction, due to the radiating pseudopodia and the radial spines
usually present, and partly perhaps by active (if only feeble) movements of
the pseudopodia.


220. _Locomotion._--Active locomotion of the whole body, which is very
probably to be regarded as voluntary, occurs in the Radiolaria in three
different modes; (1) the vibratile movement of the flagellate swarm-spores;
(2) the swimming of the floating organisms; (3) the slow creeping of those
which rest accidentally upon the bottom. {cxli}The _vibratile_ movement of
the swarm-spores is the result of active sinuous oscillation of the single
or multiple flagellum, and is not essentially different from that of
ordinary flagellate Infusoria (see note A). Of the active swimming of
mature Radiolaria, only that form is known which is vertical in direction
and causes the sinking and rising in the sea-water. This is probably, for
the most part (perhaps exclusively), due to increase or diminution in the
specific gravity, which is perhaps brought about by the retraction or
protrusion of the pseudopodia; slow, oscillating, sinuous motions of these
organs have been directly observed to take place (though very slowly) in
suspended living Radiolaria. The most important hydrostatic organ is
probably the calymma, by the contraction of which the specific gravity is
increased, while it is diminished by its expansion; the contraction is
probably brought about by active contraction of the sarcodictyum, and is
connected with exosmosis, while the expansion is probably due to the
elasticity of the calymma and the inception of water by endosmosis. In the
#Acanthometra# (§ 96) the peculiar myophriscs appear to be charged with the
duty of distending the gelatinous envelope, and thus diminishing the
specific gravity; the latter increases again when the myophriscs are
relaxed, and the calymma contracts by virtue of its own elasticity (see
note B). The slow _creeping locomotion_ exhibited by Radiolaria on a glass
slide under the microscope, does not differ from that of the Thalamophora
(Monothalamia and Polythalamia), but can only occur normally when the
animal accidentally comes into contact with a solid surface or sinks to the
bottom of the sea. Whether this actually occurs periodically is not known
(see note C). The slow or gliding locomotion exhibited by creeping Monozoa
on a glass slide is due to muscle-like contractions of bundles of
pseudopodia, just as in the case of the social central capsules of Polyzoa,
which live together in the same coenobium and are able to move within their
common calymma sometimes centrifugally to its surface, sometimes towards
the centre where they aggregate into a roundish mass (see note D).

  A. Regarding the movement of the flagella in mature swarm-spores compare
  L. N. 22, p. 375; L. N. 26, pp. 31, 35; L. N. 41, p. 452, and L. N. 52,
  p. 170.

  B. On the active vertical swimming movements of mature Radiolaria,
  especially the cause of sinking and rising, see L. N. 16, p. 134; L. N.
  41, p. 443, and L. N. 52, pp. 97-102.

  C. On the active horizontal creeping movements of mature Radiolaria on a
  firm ground, compare L. N. 12, p. 10, and L. N. 16, pp. 132-134.

  D. Regarding the motion of social central capsules within the same
  coenobium and the changes thus brought about in the structure of the
  calymma, see L. N. 16, pp. 119-127, and L. N. 52, pp. 75-82.


221. _Contraction._--Motions, which are due to the contraction of
individual portions and cause changes in volume or form, have been partly
already spoken of under the head of locomotion (§ 220) and are partly
connected with other functions. Examples may be seen in the contraction of
the central capsule and of the calymma. A certain {cxlii}contraction of the
central capsule is probably brought about by the myophanes, which arise by
differentiation of the endoplasm and hence may assume different forms in
the four legions. In the SPUMELLARIA, where numerous radial fibrillæ run
from the central nucleus to the capsule membrane (§ 77), the endoplasm is
probably driven out evenly through all the pores of the capsule membrane by
their simultaneous contraction, and hence the volume of the capsule is
diminished in all directions.  The ACANTHARIA probably behave similarly,
but are different, inasmuch as the number of their contractile radial
fibrillæ is less, and special axial threads (§ 78) are already
differentiated. In the NASSELLARIA it is probable that owing to the
contraction of the divergent myophane fibrillæ in the podoconus the
vertical axis of the latter is shortened, the opercular rods of the
porochora are lifted, and the endoplasm driven out of its pores, so that
the volume of the monaxon central capsule is diminished (§ 79). In the
PHÆODARIA the same result is probably brought about by the contraction of
the cortical myophane fibrillæ, which run meridionally along the inside of
the capsule membrane from the apical to the basal pole of the vertical main
axis, where they are inserted into the periphery of the astropyle; since
the volume of the capsule is diminished by their contraction (their
spheroidal figure becoming more nearly spherical) the endoplasm will be
driven out through the proboscis of the astropyle. Whilst these
contractions of the central capsule are largely due to differentiated
muscle-like threads of endoplasm (myophanes), this appears to be but rarely
the case with the contractions of the extracapsulum (_e.g._, the myophriscs
of the #Acanthometra#, § 96). Most of the phenomena of contraction which
can be observed in the calymma and pseudopodia depend upon exoplasmatic
currents (§ 209).


222. _Protection._--Of the utmost importance, both for the physiology and
for the morphology of the Radiolaria are their manifold protective
functions, which we now consider under the heading "protection." From the
physiological point of view the consideration of the exposed situation in
which the delicate, free-swimming Radiolarian organism lives, and the
numerous dangers which beset it in the struggle for existence, would lead
_a priori_ to the expectation, that many special protective adaptations
would be developed by natural selection. On the other hand, morphological
experience shows us that this latter has been in action for immeasurable
periods, and has gradually produced an abundance of the most remarkable
protective modifications. Examples of these may be found in the formation
of the voluminous calymma, as a gelatinous protective covering for the
central capsule, and further, the formation of the capsule membrane itself,
which separates the generative contents of the central capsule from the
nutritive exoplasm. The phosphorescence of the central capsule, too (§
223), may be regarded as a useful protective arrangement; as also the
radiating of the numerous pseudopodia in all directions from the surface of
the calymma; for they are of great significance to the {cxliii}well-being
of the organism, both as sensory organs and as prehensile organs. By far
the most important and most varied means for the actual defence of the soft
body is to be seen in the endless modifications of the skeleton; first, in
the production of the enclosing lattice-shells and projecting radial
spines, but especially also in the very varied structure of the individual
parts of the skeleton, and in the special differentiation of the small
appendicular organs which grow out from it (hairs, thorns, spines, scales,
spathillæ, anchors, &c.). Finally "mimicry" possesses a considerable
significance among the different forms of adaptation which are to be
observed in this class.


223. _Phosphorescence._--Many Radiolarians shine in the dark, and their
phosphorescence presents the same phenomena as that of other luminous
marine organisms; it is increased by mechanical and chemical irritation, or
renewed if already extinguished. The light is sometimes greenish, sometimes
yellowish, and appears generally (if not always) to radiate from the
intracapsular fatty spheres (§ 73). Thus these latter unite several
functions, inasmuch as they serve, firstly, as reserve stores of nutriment,
secondly, as hydrostatic apparatus, and thirdly, as luminous organs for the
protection of the Radiolaria; probably the light acts by frightening other
animals, for the phosphorescent animals are provided with spines,
nettle-cells, poison glands or other defensive weapons. The production of
the light depends probably, as in other phosphorescent organisms, upon the
slow oxidation of the fat-globules, which combine with active oxygen in the
presence of alkalis. Phosphorescence is very likely widely distributed
among the Radiolaria.

  The shining of the Radiolaria in the dark has been noticed by the
  earliest observers of the class (see L. N. 1, p. 163, L. N. 16, p. 2, and
  L. N. 52, pp. 136-139). In the winter of 1859 I observed the production
  of light in the case of many monozootic and polyzootic Radiolaria, but
  inadvertently omitted to record the fact in my Monograph. I made more
  accurate observations in the winter of 1866 at Lanzerote in the Canary
  Islands, and convinced myself the the light emanates from the central
  capsule, and in particular from the fat-globules contained in it. In most
  Polycyttaria (both #Collosphærida# and #Sphærozoida#), when each central
  capsule contains a large central oil-globule the light radiates from it.
  In _Collozoum serpentinum_ (Pl. 3, figs. 2, 3) each cylindrical central
  capsule contains a row of luminous spherules like a string of beads. In
  _Alacorys friderici_ (Pl. 65, fig. 1) the four-lobed central capsule
  contains four shining points. Karl Brandt has recently made more detailed
  communication on this point (L. N. 52, p. 137).


224. _Sensation._--The general irritability which we ascribe to all
organisms, and as the basis of which we regard the protoplasm, remains at
an inferior stage of development in the Radiolaria. For although they are
subject to various stimuli, and certainly possess a power of
discrimination, special sensory organs are not differentiated; the
peripheral portions of the protoplasm, and especially the pseudopodia,
rather act both as organs of the different kinds of sensation and various
modes of motion. That different Radiolaria have attained different degrees
of development in this respect may be seen {cxliv}partly by direct
observation of the reaction of the living organism towards various stimuli,
and partly by the comparison of the different conditions of existence under
which Radiolarians exist, both in the most various depths of the ocean and
in all climatic zones (see note A). In general the Radiolaria seem to be
sensitive to the following stimuli; (1) pressure (see note B); (2)
temperature (see note C); (3) light (see note D); (4) chemical composition
of the sea-water (see note E). The reaction towards these stimuli,
corresponding to the sensation of pleasure or dislike which they call
forth, is shown in various forms of motion of the protoplasm, changes in
the currents in it, contraction of the central capsule, changes in the
size, position, and form of the pseudopodia, changes in the volume of the
calymma (by the evocation of water), &c. Among the sensory functions of the
Radiolaria must be especially mentioned their remarkably developed
perception of hydrostatic equilibrium (see note F), as well as their
perception of distances, so clearly shown in the production of equal
lattice-meshes and other regularly formed skeletal structures (see note G).

  A. I can add but little to the communication which I made twenty-four
  years ago regarding sensation in the Radiolaria (L. N. 16, pp. 128-131).
  The most important point would be the great difference in irritability
  which must obtain between the pelagic, zonarial and abyssal Radiolaria,
  which may be assumed from a consideration of their very different
  conditions of existence as regards pressure, light, warmth, nutrition,
  &c. It is natural to suppose that the numerous abyssal Radiolaria,
  discovered by the Challenger, which live at great depths (2000 to 4500
  fathoms) in complete darkness, in icy cold and under an enormous
  pressure, must have quite different sensations of pleasure from their
  pelagic relatives which live at the surface of the sea under an
  equatorial sun. Karl Brandt has recently added much to our knowledge
  regarding the special action of different vital conditions upon the
  various Polycyttaria and the degrees of their irritability (L. N. 52, pp.
  113-132).

  B. Regarding the sensation of pressure or sensation of touch of the
  Radiolaria and the various degrees of their mechanical irritability, see
  L. N. 16, p. 129; L. N. 41, p. 464.

  C. Regarding the sensation of warmth or temperature-sense and its
  dependence upon different climatic relations, see L. N. 16, p. 129; L. N.
  52, pp. 114-129.

  D. Regarding the sensation of light, compare L. N. 16, p. 128; L. N. 42,
  p. 304; L. N. 52, pp. 102-104, 114.

  E. Regarding the sense of taste of the Radiolaria or their peculiar
  sensitiveness towards the different chemical composition of the water,
  change in its salinity, presence of organic impurities, &c., see L. N.
  16, p. 130; L. N. 52, pp. 103, 113. This chemical irritability seems to
  be the most highly developed sense in the Radiolaria, even more so than
  their mechanical irritability.

  F. The perception of hydrostatic equilibrium among the Radiolaria is
  immediately visible from the position which their bodies, floating freely
  in the water, assume spontaneously, and from the symmetrical development
  of the skeleton, which by its gravitation necessitates a definite
  position. It may be assumed that the development of the various
  geometrical ground forms which correspond to a definite position of
  equilibrium, is the result of this particular kind of perception (compare
  §§ 40-45).

  {cxlv}G. The plastic perception of distance of the pseudopodia is shown
  by the symmetry with which the forms composing the regular skeletal
  structures (_e.g._, the ordinary lattice-spheres with regular hexagonal
  meshes, the radial spines with equidistant branches) are excreted from
  the exoplasm. Both this form of sensation and the one first mentioned
  (note F) have hitherto received scarcely any attention, but are deserving
  of a thorough physiological investigation.


225. _The Cell-Soul (Zellseele)._--The common central vital principle,
commonly called the "soul," which is considered to be the regulator of all
vital functions, appears in the Radiolaria as in other Protista in its
simplest form, as the cell-soul. By the continual activity of this central
"psyche" all vital functions are maintained in unbroken action, and in
uniform correlation. It is also probable that by it the stimulations which
the peripheral portions of the cell receive from the outer world are first
transmitted into true sensation, and that, on the other hand, the volition,
which alone calls forth spontaneous movements, proceeds from it. The
central capsule is most likely the sole organ of this cell-soul or central
psychic organ, and the active portion may be either the endoplasm or the
nucleus, or both. The central capsule may thus (apart from its function as
a sporangium, § 215) be regarded as a simple ganglion cell, physiologically
comparable to the nervous centre of the higher animals, whilst the exoplasm
(sarcomatrix and pseudopodia) are to be compared to the peripheral nervous
system and sense organs of the latter. The great simplicity of the
functions of the cell-soul which appear in the Radiolaria, and the intimate
connection of their different psychic activities, give to these unicellular
Protista a special significance for the comprehension of the monistic
elements of a natural psychology.

  Regarding the theory of the cell-soul as the only psychological theory
  which is able to explain naturally the true nature of the life of the
  soul in all organisms as well as in man, see my address on cell-souls and
  soul-cells ("Zellseelen und Seelenzellen") in Gesammelte populäre
  Vorträge aus dem Gebiete der Entwickelungslehre, Heft 1, p. 143; Bonn,
  1878.

CHAPTER IX.--GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.

(§§ 226-240.)

226. _Universal Marine Distribution._--Radiolaria occur in all the seas of
the world, in all climatic zones and at all depths. Probably under normal
conditions they always float freely in the water, whether their usual
position be at the surface (pelagic), or at a certain depth (zonarial), or
near to the bottom of the sea (abyssal). This appears both from numerous
direct observations, as well as from conclusions which may be drawn from
their organisation (and especially their promorphology) regarding their
floating life (compare §§ 40-50, 219, 220). Hitherto no observation has
been recorded, which justifies the assumption that Radiolaria live anywhere
upon the bottom of the sea (on stones, Algæ, or other firm substances),
either sessile or creeping. They perform the latter action, however, when
they fall accidentally upon a firm basis or are accidentally placed upon
it, but they seem normally always to float freely in the water with
pseudopodia radiating in all directions. Active free-swimming movements are
only met with in the case of the flagellate zoospores (§ 142). The
development of Radiolaria in large masses is very remarkable (see note A),
and in many parts of the ocean is so great that they play an important part
in the economy of marine life, especially as food for other pelagic and
abyssal animals (see note B). Medium salinity of the water seems to be most
favourable to their development in masses, although it is not unknown in
seas of high and low salinity (see note C). There are no Radiolaria in
fresh water (see note D).

  A. The development of Radiolaria takes place in many parts of the ocean
  in astonishingly large masses on the surface, in different strata, and
  near the bottom. The #Collodaria# (and especially the Sphærozoida) often
  cover the surface of the sea in millions, and form a shining layer,
  phosphorescent in the dark like the _Noctilucæ_, as I observed in 1859 in
  the Strait of Messina, in 1866 at the Canaries, and in 1881 in the Indian
  Ocean. Similar masses of _Sphærozoum_ and _Acanthometron_ were seen by
  Johannes Müller on the French and Ligurian coasts (L. N. 12), and John
  Murray found another in the Gulf Stream, off the Færöe Islands, from the
  surface to a depth of 600 fathoms; considerable masses of large PHÆODARIA
  live there also.

  B. The alimentary canal of Medusæ, Salpæ, Crustacea, Pteropoda, and many
  other pelagic animals is a rich field for the discovery of Radiolaria,
  and many of the species hereinafter described are from such sources.
  Fossil coprolites too (_e.g._, those from the Jura) often contain many
  Polycystina.

  C. Some ACANTHARIA (#Acanthometra#) and PHÆODARIA (species of _Mesocena_
  and _Dictyocha_) {cxlvii}live in the Baltic; I found their skeletons in
  the alimentary canal of _Aurelia_, Ascidians and Copepods.

  D. The so-called "fresh-water Radiolaria," which have been described by
  Focke, Greeff, Grenacher and others, are all Heliozoa, without either
  central capsule or calymma.


227. _Local distribution._--As regards their local distribution and its
boundaries the Radiolaria show in general the same relations as other
pelagic animals. Since they are only to a very slight extent, if at all,
capable of active horizontal locomotion, the dispersion of the different
species from their point of development (or "centre of creation") is
dependent upon oceanic currents, the play of winds and waves and all the
accidental causes which influence the transport of pelagic animals in
general. These passive migrations are here, however, as always, of the
greatest significance, and bring about the wide distribution of individual
species in a far higher degree than any active wanderings could do. Any one
who has ever followed a stream of pelagic animals for hours and seen how
millions of creatures closely packed together are in a short time carried
along for miles by such a current, will be in no danger of underestimating
the enormous importance of marine currents in the passive migration of the
fauna of the sea. Such constant currents may, however, be recognised both
near the bottom of the sea and at various depths, as well as at the
surface, and are therefore of just as much significance for the abyssal and
zonarial as for the pelagic Radiolaria. It is easy to explain by this means
how it is that so many animals of this class (probably indeed the great
majority) have a wide range of distribution. The number of _cosmopolitan_
species which live in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans is already
relatively large. In each of these three great ocean basins, too, many
species show a wide distribution. On the other hand, there are very many
species which are hitherto known only from one locality, and probably many
small local faunas exist, characterised by the special development of
particular groups. The observations which we at present possess are too
incomplete, and the rich material of the Challenger is too incompletely
worked out, to enable any definite conclusions to be drawn regarding the
local distribution of Radiolaria.

  The statements made in the systematic portion of this Report regarding
  the distribution of the Challenger Radiolaria are very incomplete. In
  most cases only one locality is mentioned, and that is the station (§
  240) in the preparations or bottom deposit from which I first found the
  species in question. Afterwards I often found the same species again in
  one or more additional stations (not seldom in numerous preparations both
  from the Pacific and Atlantic), without the possibility of adding them to
  the habitat recorded under the description. The necessary accurate
  determination and identification of the species (measuring the different
  dimensions, counting the pores, &c.), would have occupied too much time,
  and the writing of this extensive Report would have lasted not ten but
  twenty or thirty years.


228. _Horizontal Distribution._--From the extensive collections of the
Challenger and from the other collections which have furnished a welcome
supplement to them, it appears {cxlviii}that Radiolaria are distributed
throughout all seas without distinction of zones and physical conditions,
even though these latter may be the cause of differences in their
qualitative and quantitative development. In the case of the Radiolaria as
well as of many other classes of animals, the law holds good that the
richest development of forms and the greatest number of species occurs
between the tropics, whilst the frigid zones (both Arctic and Antarctic)
exhibit great masses of individuals, but relatively few genera and species
(see note A). In the Challenger collection the greatest abundance of
species of Radiolaria is exhibited by those preparations which were
collected at low latitudes in the immediate neighbourhood of the equator;
this is true both of the Atlantic (Stations 346 to 349) and of the Pacific
(Stations 266 to 274); in the former the richest of all is Station 347
(lat. 0° 15' S.), in the latter Station 271 (lat. 0° 33' S.) (see note B).
From the tropics the abundance of species seems to diminish regularly
towards the poles, and more rapidly in the northern than in the southern
hemisphere; the latter also appears, considered as a whole, to possess more
species than the former. A limit to the life of the Radiolaria towards the
poles has not yet been found; the expeditions towards the North Pole (see
note C), like those towards the South (see note D), have obtained
bottom-deposits and ice enclosures which contained Radiolaria; in some of
the most northerly and most southerly positions which were reached the
number of Radiolaria enclosed in the ice was relatively great.

  A. The greater abundance of Radiolaria in the tropical seas is probably
  to be explained by the more favourable conditions of existence, and in
  particular the larger quantity of nutritive material (especially of
  decayed animals) and not by the higher temperature of the surface, for at
  depths of from 2000 to 3000 fathoms where the abyssal Radiolaria live,
  the temperature is but little above the freezing point or even below it
  (compare the bottom temperatures in the list of Challenger Stations, §
  240).

  B. Station 271 of the Challenger Expedition, situated almost on the
  equator in the Mid Pacific (lat. 0° 33' S.), exceeds all other parts of
  the earth, hitherto known, in respect of its wealth in Radiolaria, and
  this is true of the pelagic as well as of the zonarial and abyssal forms.
  In the Station List the deposit at this point is stated to be
  "Globigerina ooze"; but after the calcareous matter has been removed by
  means of acid, the purest Radiolarian ooze remains, rich in varied and
  remarkable species. More than one hundred new species have been described
  from this Station alone.

  C. Regarding the Arctic Radiolaria compare the contributions of Ehrenberg
  (L. N. 24, pp. 138, 139, 195) and Brady on the English North Polar
  Expedition, 1875-76 (Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., 1878, vol. i. pp. 425,
  437).

  D. Regarding the Antarctic Radiolaria, compare § 230, note A, and
  Ehrenberg, Mikrogeologie (L. N. 6, Taf. xxxv., A.), also L. N. 24, pp.
  136-139.


229. _Fauna of the Pacific Ocean._--From the splendid discoveries of the
Challenger, and the supplementary observations obtained from other sources,
the Pacific seems to be the ocean basin which is richest both
quantitatively and qualitatively in Radiolarian life, {cxlix}excelling both
the Indian and Atlantic Oceans in this respect. It may be assumed with
great probability that by far the largest portion of the Pacific has a
depth of between 2000 and 3000 fathoms, and that its bottom is covered
either with Radiolarian ooze (§ 237) or with a red clay (§ 239), which
contains many SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, and has probably been derived
for a great part from broken down and metamorphosed Radiolarian ooze (see
note A). Pure Radiolarian ooze was found by the Challenger eastwards in the
Central Pacific (over a wide area between lat. 12° N. and 12° S., Stations
265 to 274), and also westwards in the latitude of the Philippines, twenty
degrees to the east of them (between lat. 5° N. and 15° N.). The great
abundance of Radiolaria present in the neighbourhood of the Philippines and
in the Sunda Sea was already known from other investigations (note B). The
red clay also, which covers a great part of the bottom of the North
Pacific, and which was obtained of very constant composition by the
Challenger between lat. 35° N. and 38° N., from Japan to the meridian of
Honolulu (from long. 144° E. to 156° W.), is so pre-eminently rich in
Radiolaria that it often approaches in composition the Radiolarian ooze,
and has probably been derived from it. The track of the Challenger through
the tropical and northern parts of the Pacific describes nearly three sides
of a rectangle, which includes about half of the enormous Pacific basin,
and from this as well as from other supplementary observations it may with
great probability be concluded that by far the largest part of the bed of
the Pacific (at least three-fourths) is covered either with Radiolarian
ooze or with red clay, which contains a larger or smaller amount of the
remains of Radiolaria. With this agrees also the important fact that the
numerous preparations of pelagic materials and collections of pelagic
animals, which were collected by the Challenger in the Pacific, almost
always indicate a corresponding amount of Radiolarian life on the surface.
This is true in particular also of the South Pacific, between lat. 33° S.
and 40° S. (from long. 133° W. to 73° W., Stations 287 to 301); the surface
of this southern region and the different bathymetrical zones were rich in
new and peculiar species of Radiolaria.

  A. Many specimens of bottom-deposits from the Pacific, which are entered
  in the Challenger lists either as "red clay" or "Globigerina ooze,"
  contain larger or smaller quantities of Radiolaria, and the number of
  different species of SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA which they contain is
  often so great that the deposit might have been almost as appropriately
  termed "Radiolarian ooze," _e.g._, Stations 241 to 245, and 270, 271
  (compare §§ 236-239).

  B. Pacific Radiolarian ooze was first obtained by Lieutenant Brooke (May
  11, 1859) between the Philippines and Marianne Islands, from a depth of
  3300 fathoms (lat. 18° 3' N., long. 129° 11' E.). Ehrenberg, who first
  described it, found seventy-nine different species of Polycystina in it,
  and reported "that their quantity and the number of different forms
  increased with the depth" (Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad. d. Wiss.
  Berlin, 1860, pp. 466, 588, 766).


230. _Fauna of the Indian Ocean._--As regards its Radiolarian fauna the
Indian Ocean is the least known of the three great basins. Still the few
limited spots, regarding which {cl}investigations are forthcoming, indicate
a very rich development of Radiolarian life. Probably it approaches more
nearly the fauna of the Pacific than that of the Atlantic, both as regards
the abundance and the morphological characters of its species. The
researches of the Challenger are very limited and incomplete as regards the
Indian Ocean, for the expedition only just touched upon this great ocean
basin (2000 to 3000 fathoms deep) at its two extremities (westwards at the
Cape of Good Hope and eastwards at Tasmania), its course lying for the most
part south of lat. 45° S. and extending beyond lat. 65° S. (from Station
149 to 158, south of lat. 50° S.). It is true that this portion of the
South Indian Ocean was shown to contain Radiolaria everywhere, but these
were more plentiful in individuals than in species. Only from Station 156
to Station 159 (between lat. 62° and 47° S., and long. 95° and 130° E.) was
the bottom, which consisted partly of Diatom ooze and partly of Globigerina
ooze, richer in species (see note A). The gaps left by the Challenger in
the investigation of the Indian Ocean, have, however, been to some extent
filled from other sources. As early as 1859 the English "Cyclops"
expedition had shown that the bottom of the Indian Ocean to the east of
Zanzibar (lat. 9° 37' S., long. 61° 33' W.) is covered with pure
Radiolarian ooze (see note B). Also since the Tertiary rocks of the Nicobar
Islands are for the most part of the same composition, and since a great
abundance of Radiolaria has been shown to be present both in the east part
of the ocean, between the Cocos Islands and the Sunda Archipelago (see note
C), and in the northern part or Arabian Sea between Socotra and Ceylon (see
note D); it may be assumed with great probability that the greater part of
the basin of the Indian Ocean, like that of the Pacific, is covered either
with Radiolarian ooze or with the characteristic red clay. With this agrees
the richness of the surface of the Indian Ocean in Radiolaria of the most
various groups, which has been more extensively demonstrated.

  A. The Radiolarian fauna collected by the Challenger on the voyage from
  the Cape to Melbourne, shows in part, namely, from Station 156 to Station
  158, very peculiar and characteristic composition; in particular, the
  Diatom ooze of Station 157 passes over in great part into a Radiolarian
  ooze, mainly composed of #Sphærellaria#. This is worthy of a more
  thorough investigation than I was able, owing to lack of material and
  time, to give it.

  B. The remarkably pure Radiolarian ooze of Zanzibar, discovered by
  Ehrenberg in 1859, was the earliest known recent example of that deposit.
  It was brought up by Captain Pullen of the English man-of-war "Cyclops,"
  from a depth of 2200 fathoms, between Zanzibar and the Seychelles, and
  "under a magnifying power of 300 diameters, showed at the first glance a
  mass of almost pure Polycystina, such as no sample of a deep-sea deposit
  has hitherto shown. It is very noticeable that in the whole of this mass
  of living forms, no calcareous shells are to be seen" (Ehrenberg, L. N.
  24, pp. 148, 149).

  C. For the most important material from the Indian Ocean, I am indebted
  to Captain Heinrich Rabbe of Bremen, who during many voyages in the
  Indian Ocean, in his ship "Joseph Haydn," made numerous collections in
  different localities with the tow-net and the trawl, and admirably
  preserved the rich collections thus made. The greatest abundance of
  Radiolaria was found in those {cli}obtained to the east of Madagascar,
  and next in those from the neighbourhood of the Cocos Islands. I take
  this opportunity of expressing my thanks to Captain Rabbe for the
  liberality with which he placed all this valuable material at my
  disposal.

  D. On my voyage from Aden to Bombay, and thence to Ceylon (1881), and
  especially on my return journey from Ceylon, between the Maldive Islands
  and Socotra (1882), I carried on a number of experiments with a surface
  net, which yielded a rich fauna of pelagic animals, and among them many
  new species of Radiolaria, for observation. On several nights when the
  smooth surface of the Indian Ocean, unrippled by any wind, shone with the
  most lovely phosphorescent light, I drew up water from the surface with a
  bucket, and obtained a rich booty. A number of other new species of
  Radiolaria from very various parts of the Indian Ocean I obtained from
  the alimentary canal of pelagic animals, such as Medusæ, Salpæ,
  Crustacea, &c. Although the total number of Radiolaria known to me from
  the Indian Ocean is much less than from the Atlantic and Pacific, there
  are several new genera and numerous species among them, which show that a
  careful study of this fauna will be of wide interest.


231. _Fauna of the Atlantic Ocean._--The Atlantic Ocean in all parts, of
which the pelagic fauna has been examined, has shown the same constant
presence of Radiolaria, and in certain parts of its abyssal deposits a
larger or smaller quantity of different types belonging to this class; on
the whole, however, its Radiolarian fauna is inferior to that of the
Pacific, and probably also to that of the Indian Ocean, both in quantity
and quality. Pure Radiolarian ooze, such as is so extensively found on the
floor of the Pacific, and in certain places in that of the Indian Ocean,
has not yet been found in the Atlantic (see § 237). The red clay, too, of
the deep Atlantic does not seem to be so rich in Radiolaria as that of the
Pacific; nevertheless, the number of species peculiar to the Atlantic is
very large, and at certain points the abundance of species as well as of
individuals seems to be scarcely less than in the Pacific. This is
especially true of the eastern equatorial zone not far from Sierra Leone,
Stations 347 to 352 (see note A); also of the South Atlantic between Buenos
Ayres and Tristan da Cunha, Stations 324, 325, 331 to 333 (see note B);
and, lastly, in the North Atlantic in the Gulf Stream and near the Canary
Islands (see note C). The fauna of the latter agrees for the most part with
that of the Mediterranean (see note D). In addition to the material
collected by the Challenger, other deep-sea investigations have furnished
bottom-deposits from different parts of the ocean, which have proved very
rich in Radiolaria (see note E). Furthermore, since the island of Barbados
consists for the most part of fossil Radiolarian ooze, it is very probable
that at certain parts of the tropical Atlantic true Radiolarian ooze, like
that of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, will eventually be found in depths
between 2000 and 3000 fathoms, perhaps over a considerable area.

  A. The tropical zone of the eastern Atlantic seems to be especially rich
  in peculiar Radiolaria of different species. This is shown by numerous
  preparations from the surface, and from various depths (between lat. 3°
  S. and 11° N., and long. 14° W. to 18° W.), which were made towards the
  {clii}end of the cruise. Unfortunately no bottom-deposits were obtained
  from the most important stations (except Nos. 346 and 347, depths 2350
  and 2250 fathoms) in this region; at these the deposit was a Globigerina
  ooze containing numerous different species of Radiolaria.

  B. In the South Atlantic, between Buenos Ayres and Tristan da Cunha
  (between lat. 35° S. and 43° S., long. 8° W. and 57° W.) there appears to
  be a long stretch covered partly with Globigerina ooze (Stations 331 to
  334), or red clay (Stations 329, 330), partly with blue mud (Stations 318
  to 328), which contains not only large masses of individuals but numerous
  peculiar species of SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA. The preparations from
  the surface-takings of this region are also rich in these, as well as in
  peculiar PHÆODARIA.

  C. The northern part of the Atlantic appears on the whole to be inferior
  to the tropical and southern portions as regards its richness in
  Radiolaria, and from the western half more especially, only few species
  are known. From my researches at Lanzerote in 1866-67, it appears that
  the pelagic fauna of the Canary Islands is very rich in them, as is also
  the Gulf Stream in the neighbourhood of the Færöe Channel, according to
  the investigations of John Murray (see his Report on the "Knight-Errant"
  Expedition, Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin., vol. xi., 1882).

  D. The Radiolaria of the Mediterranean are of special interest, because
  almost all our knowledge of these organisms in the living conditions and
  of their vital functions has been derived from investigations conducted
  on its shores. Johannes Müller laid the foundation of this knowledge by
  his investigations at Messina, and on the Ligurian and French coasts at
  Nice, Cette, and St. Tropez (L. N. 10). The many new Radiolaria which I
  described in my Monograph (L. N. 16, 1862), were for the most part taken
  at Messina, the place which possesses a richer pelagic fauna than any
  other, so far as is yet known, in the Mediterranean. Other new species I
  found afterwards at Villafranca near Nice, in 1864 (L. N. 19), at
  Portofino near Genoa (1880), at Corfu (1877), and at other points on the
  coast. In Messina also, Richard Hertwig collected the material for his
  valuable treatise on the Organisation of the Radiolaria (L. N. 33), after
  he had previously made investigations into their histology at Ajaccio in
  Corsica (L. N. 26). Lastly, at Naples, Cienkowski (L. N. 22) and Karl
  Brandt (L. N. 38, 39, 52) carried out their important investigations into
  the reproduction and symbiosis of the Radiolaria. With respect to the
  character of its Radiolaria, the Mediterranean fauna is to be regarded as
  a special province of the North Atlantic.

  E. Among the smaller contributions which have been made towards our
  knowledge of the Atlantic Radiolarian fauna, the communications of
  Ehrenberg on the deposits obtained in sounding for the Atlantic cable,
  and on the Mexican Gulf Stream near Florida, deserve special mention (L.
  N. 24, pp. 138, 139-145).


232. _Vertical Distribution._--The most important general result of the
discoveries of the Challenger, as regards the vertical or bathymetrical
distribution of the Radiolaria, is the interesting fact that numerous
species of this class are found living at the most various depths of the
sea, and that certain species are limited to particular bathymetrical
zones, _i.e._, are adapted to the conditions which obtain there. In this
respect three different Radiolarian faunas may be distinguished, which may
be shortly termed "pelagic," "zonarial," and "abyssal." The _pelagic_
Radiolaria swim at the surface, and when they sink (_e.g._, in a stormy
sea), only descend to a small depth, probably not more than from {cliii}20
to 30 fathoms (§ 233). The complicated conditions of existence created by
the keen struggle for existence at the surface of the sea, give rise to the
formation of very numerous pelagic species, especially of Porulosa
(SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA). The _abyssal_ Radiolaria are very different
from those just mentioned; they live at the bottom of the deep-sea, not
resting upon nor attached to it, but probably floating at a little distance
above it, and are adapted to the conditions of existence which obtain there
(§ 235). Here the Osculosa (NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA) seem to predominate.
The _zonarial_ Radiolaria live floating at various depths between the
pelagic and abyssal species (§ 234). In their morphological characters they
gradually approach the pelagic forms upwards and the abyssal downwards.

  The views which have hitherto been held regarding the bathymetrical or
  vertical distribution of the Radiolaria have been entirely altered by the
  magnificent discoveries of the Challenger, and especially by the
  important observations of Sir Wyville Thomson (L. N. 31) and John Murray
  (L. N. 27). These two distinguished deep-sea explorers have, as a result
  of their wide experience, been convinced that Radiolaria exist at all
  depths of the ocean, and that there are large numbers of true deep-sea
  species which are never found at the surface of the sea nor at slight
  depths (L. N. 31, vol. i. pp. 236-238; L. N. 27, pp. 523, 525). The
  result of my ten years' work upon the Challenger Radiolaria, and the
  comparative study of more than a thousand mountings from all depths, has
  only been to confirm this opinion, and I am further persuaded that it
  will some day be possible by the aid of suitable nets (not yet invented)
  to distinguish different faunistic zones in the various depths of the
  sea. In this connection may be mentioned the specially interesting fact
  that the species of Radiolaria of one and the same family present in the
  different depths characteristic morphological distinctions, which
  obviously correspond to their different physiological relations in the
  struggle for existence. Owing to those extensive discoveries, the
  representation which I gave in my Monograph (1862, L. N. 16, pp. 172-196)
  of the vertical distribution of the Radiolaria, and of their life in the
  greatest depths of the sea, has been entirely changed. Compare also
  Bütschli (L. N. 41, p. 466).


233. _The Pelagic Fauna._--The surface of the open ocean seems everywhere,
at a certain distance from the coast at least, to be peopled by crowds of
living Radiolaria. In the tropical zone these pelagic crowds consist of
many different species, whilst in the frigid zones, on the other hand, they
are made up of many individuals belonging to but few species. Most of these
inhabitants of the surface may be regarded as truly pelagic species, which
either remain always at the surface or descend only very slightly below it.
Probably most Porulosa (both SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA) belong to this
group; whilst but few Osculosa occur in it, and fewer PHÆODARIA than
NASSELLARIA. In general the pelagic Radiolaria are distinguished from the
abyssal by the more delicate and slender structure of their skeletons; the
pores of the lattice-shells are larger, the intervening trabeculæ thinner;
the armature of spines, spathillæ, anchors, &c., is more various and more
highly developed. Numerous forms are to be found among the pelagic
{cliv}Radiolaria which have either an incomplete skeleton or none at all.
When the pelagic forms leave the surface on account of unfavourable
weather, they appear only to sink to slight depths (probably not below 20
or 30 fathoms). Within the limits of the same family the size of the
pelagic species seems to be on an average greater than that of the related
abyssal forms.


234. _The Zonarial Fauna._--Between the pelagic fauna living at the surface
of the open sea and the abyssal, which floats immediately over the bottom,
there appears to be usually a middle fauna, which inhabits the different
bathymetrical zones of the intermediate water, and hence may be shortly
called the "zonarial" fauna.  The different species of Radiolaria which
inhabit these different strata in the same vertical column of water present
differences corresponding to those of the plants composing the several
zones of vegetation, which succeed each other at different heights on a
mountain; they correspond to the different conditions of existence which
are presented by the different strata of water, and to which they have
become adapted in the struggle for existence. The existence of such
bathymetrical zones has been shown by those important, if not numerous,
observations of the Challenger, in which the tow-net was used at different
depths at one and the same Station. In several cases the character of the
Radiolarian fauna at different depths presented characteristic differences.

  For the present, and until we are better acquainted with the characters
  of the Radiolarian fauna at different depths, we may distinguish
  provisionally the following _five bathymetrical zones_:--(1) The
  _pelagic_ zone, extending from the surface to a depth of about 25
  fathoms; (2) the _pellucid_ zone, extending from 25 to 150 fathoms, or as
  far as the influence of the sunlight makes itself felt; (3) the _obscure_
  zone, extending from 150 to 2000 fathoms, or from the depth at which
  sunlight disappears to that at which the influence of the water
  containing carbonic acid begins and the calcareous organisms vanish; (4)
  the _siliceous_ zone, extending from 2000 or 2500 to about 3000 fathoms,
  in which only siliceous not calcareous Rhizopoda are found, and in which
  the peculiar conditions of the lowest regions have not yet appeared; (5)
  the _abyssal_ zone, in which the accumulation of the oceanic deposits,
  and the influence of the bottom currents, create new conditions of
  existence. So far as our isolated and incomplete observations of the
  zonarial Radiolarian fauna extend, it appears that the subclass Porulosa
  (SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA) predominates in the two upper zones, and as
  the depth increases is gradually replaced by the subclass Osculosa
  (NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA), so that the latter predominates in the two
  lowest zones. The obscure zone which lies in the middle is probably the
  poorest in species. In general, the morphological characters of the
  zonarial fauna appear to change gradually upwards into the delicate form
  of the pelagic and downwards into the robust constitution of the abyssal;
  so also the average size of the individuals (within the limits of the
  same family) appears to increase upwards and decrease downwards.


235. _The Abyssal Fauna._--The great majority of Radiolaria which have
hitherto been observed, and which are described in the systematic portion
of this Report, have been obtained from the bottom of the deep-sea, and
more than half of all the species have been {clv}derived from the pure
Radiolarian ooze, which forms the bed of the Central Pacific at depths of
from 2000 to 4000 fathoms (§ 237). Many of these abyssal forms were brought
up with the malacoma uninjured, and they show, both when mounted
immediately in balsam, and when preserved in alcohol, all the soft parts
almost as clearly as fresh preparations of pelagic Radiolaria. These
species are to be regarded as truly abyssal, _i.e._, as forms which live
floating only a little distance above the bottom of the deep-sea, having
become adapted to the peculiar conditions of life which obtain in the
lowest regions of the ocean. Probably the majority of the PHÆODARIA belong
to these abyssal Radiolaria, as well as a large number of NASSELLARIA, but
on the other hand, only a small number of ACANTHARIA and SPUMELLARIA are
found there. A character common to these abyssal forms, and rarely found in
those from the surface or from slight depths, is found in their small size
and their heavy massive skeletons, in which they strikingly resemble the
fossil Radiolaria of Barbados and the Nicobar Islands. The lattice-work of
the shell is coarser, its trabeculæ thicker and its pores smaller than in
pelagic species of the same group; also the apophyses (spines, spathillæ,
coronets, &c.), are much less developed than in the latter. From these true
abyssal Radiolaria must be carefully distinguished those species whose
empty skeletons, devoid of all soft parts, occur also in the Radiolarian
ooze of the deep-sea, but are clearly only the sunken remains of dead
forms, which have lived at the surface or in some of the upper zones.


236. _Deposits containing Radiolaria._--The richest collection of
Radiolaria is found in the deposits of ooze which form the bed of the
ocean. Although the pelagic material skimmed from the surface of the sea,
and the zonarial material taken by sinking the tow-net to various depths,
are always more or less rich in Radiolaria, still the number of species
thus obtained is, on the whole, much less than has hitherto been got merely
from deep-sea deposits. Of course the skeletons found in the mud of the
ocean-bed, may belong either to the abyssal species which live there (§
235), or to the zonarial (§ 234), or to the pelagic species (§ 233), for
the siliceous skeletons of these latter sink to the bottom after their
death. Almost all these remains found in the deposits belong to the
siliceous "Polycystina" (SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA); PHÆODARIA occur but
sparingly, and ACANTHARIA are entirely wanting, for their acanthin skeleton
readily dissolves. The abundance of Radiolaria varies greatly according to
the composition and origin of the deposits. In general marine deposits may
be divided into two main divisions, terrigenous and abyssal, or, more
shortly, muds and oozes. The _terrigenous_ deposits (or muds) include all
those sediments which are made up for the most part of materials worn away
from the coasts of continents and islands, or brought down into the sea by
rivers. Their greatest extent from the coast is about 200 nautical miles.
They contain varying quantities of Radiolaria, but much fewer than those of
the next group. The _abyssal_ deposits (or oozes) usually commence at a
distance of from 100 to 200 nautical miles {clvi}from the coast. In general
they are characterised by great uniformity, corresponding to the constancy
of the conditions under which they are laid down; they may be divided into
three categories, the true Radiolarian ooze (§ 237), Globigerina ooze (§
238), and red clay (§ 239). Of these three most important deep-sea
formations the first is by far the richest in Radiolaria, although the
other two contain often very many siliceous shells.

  The marvellous discoveries of the Challenger have thrown upon the nature
  of marine deposits an entirely new light, which justifies most important
  conclusions regarding the geographical distribution and geological
  significance of the Radiolaria. Since Dr. John Murray and the Abbé Renard
  will treat fully of these interesting relations in a forthcoming volume
  of the Challenger series (Report on the Deep-Sea Deposits), it will be
  sufficient here to refer to their preliminary publication already
  published (Narrative of the Cruise of H.M.S. Challenger, 1885, vol. ii.

237. _Radiolarian Ooze._--By Radiolarian ooze, in the strict sense of the
term, are understood those oceanic deposits, the greater part of which
(often more than three-quarters) is composed of the siliceous skeletons of
this class. Such _pure_ Radiolarian ooze has only been found in limited
areas of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is most conspicuous in the
Central Pacific, between lat. 12° N. and 8° S., long. 148° W. to 152° W.,
the depth being everywhere between 2000 and 3000 fathoms (Stations 266 to
268 and 272 to 274). In the deepest of the Challenger soundings (Station
225, 4475 fathoms) the bottom is composed of pure Radiolarian ooze, as well
as at the next Station in the Western Tropical Pacific (Station 226, 2300
fathoms), the latitude varying from 12° N. to 15° N., and the longitude
from 142° E. to 144° E. In the Indian Ocean also, pure Radiolarian ooze was
found in the year 1859 between Zanzibar and the Seychelles, this being the
first known example of it (§ 230). On the other hand, it has not yet been
found in the bed of the Atlantic; but the Tertiary formations of Barbados
(Antilles, § 231) like those of the Nicobar Islands (Further India), are to
be regarded as pure Radiolarian {clvii}ooze in the fossil condition.
_Mixed_ Radiolarian ooze is the name given to those deposits in which the
Radiolaria exceed any of the other organic constituents, although they do
not make up half the total mass. To this category belong a large number of
the Challenger soundings which are entered in the Station list either as
red clay or Globigerina ooze. Such mixed Radiolarian ooze has been
discovered (A) in the North Pacific in an elongated area of red clay
extending from Station 241 to Station 245 (perhaps even from Station 238 to
Station 253), that is, at least, from long. 157° E. to 175° E., between
lat. 35° N. and 37° N.; (B) in the tropical Central Pacific in the
Globigerina ooze of Stations 270 and 271. The ooze from the latter station,
situated almost on the equator (lat. 0° 33' S., long. 151° 34' W.), is
specially remarkable, for it has yielded more new species of SPUMELLARIA
and NASSELLARIA than any other Station, not excluding even the neighbouring
Stations 268, 269, and 272. Probably such mixed Radiolarian ooze is very
widely distributed in the depths of the ocean, as, for example, in the
South Pacific (Stations 288, 289, 300, and 302), and in the Southern Ocean
(Stations 156 to 159); also in the South Atlantic (Stations 324, 325, 331,
332) and in the tropical Atlantic (Stations 348 to 352). When carefully
purified and decalcified by acids, Radiolarian ooze appears as a fine
shining white powder; in the raw state it is yellowish or reddish,
sometimes reddish-brown or dark brown in colour, according to the quantity
of oxides of iron, manganese, &c., which it contains. Calcareous skeletons
(especially the tests of pelagic Foraminifera) do not occur at all or only
in very minute quantities in _pure_ Radiolarian ooze from more than 2000
fathoms, whilst specimens of _mixed_ ooze often contain considerable
quantities of them.

  Pure Radiolarian ooze was first described by Dr. John Murray as regards
  its peculiar nature and composition under the name "Radiolarian ooze"
  (1876, L. N. 27, pp. 525, 526); compare also Sir Wyville Thomson (The
  Atlantic, L. N. 31, vol. i. pp. 231-238), and John Murray (Narr. Chall.
  Exp., L. N. 53, vol. i. pt. ii. pp. 920-926, pl. N. fig. 2). The
  different specimens of pure Radiolarian ooze obtained by the Challenger
  from the Pacific, and handed to me for investigation, are from depths of
  from 2250 fathoms to 4475 fathoms, and may be divided according to their
  composition into three different groups:--I. The Radiolarian ooze of the
  Western Tropical Pacific, Stations 225 and 226, from depths of 4475 and
  2300 fathoms (lat. 11° N. to 15° N., and long. 142° E. to 144° E.). II.
  The Radiolarian ooze of the northern half of the Central Pacific,
  Stations 265 to 269, from depths of 2550 to 2900 fathoms. III. The
  Radiolarian ooze of the southern half of the Central Pacific, Stations
  270 to 274, from depths of 2350 to 2925 fathoms. A fourth group would be
  constituted by the Radiolarian ooze from the Philippines, which was
  brought up by Brooke in 1860 near the Marianne Islands from 3300 fathoms,
  and described by Ehrenberg (Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad. d. Wiss.
  Berlin, 1860, p. 765). The Diatom ooze, too, found by the Challenger in
  the Antarctic regions (Stations 152 to 157) is in some parts so rich in
  Radiolaria that it passes over into true Radiolarian ooze. Regarding the
  Radiolarian ooze from Zanzibar, obtained by Captain Pullen in 1859 from
  2200 fathoms (§ 230), we have only the incomplete communications of
  Ehrenberg (L. N. 24, p. 147). A more accurate knowledge of these deposits
  from the Indian Ocean, and of {clviii}those which we may with probability
  expect from the tropical eastern Atlantic, will be sure to increase very
  widely our knowledge of the class.


238. _Globigerina Ooze._--Next to the Radiolarian ooze proper the
Globigerina ooze is the deposit which is richest in the remains of
Radiolaria. Often these are so abundant that it is doubtful to which
category the specimen should be referred (_e.g._, Stations 270 and 271, see
§ 237). In fact, the two pass without any sharp boundary into each other,
and both present transitions to the Diatom ooze. Next to red clay (§ 239),
Globigerina ooze is the most widely distributed of all sediments, and forms
a large part of the bed of the ocean at depths of 250 to 2900 fathoms
(especially between 1000 and 2000 fathoms). It covers extensive areas at
depths below 1800 fathoms, and in still deeper water is replaced by red
clay. It is a fine-grained white, grey, or yellowish powder, which
sometimes becomes coloured rose, red, or brown owing to the admixture of
oxides of iron and manganese. True Globigerina ooze consists for the most
part of the accumulated calcareous shells of pelagic Foraminifera,
principally _Globigerina_ and _Orbulina_, but also _Hastigerina_,
_Pulvinulina_, &c. It contains usually from 50 to 80 per cent. of calcium
carbonate, the extreme values being 40 and 95 per cent. After this has been
removed by acids, there remains a residue, which consists partly of the
siliceous shells of Radiolaria and Diatoms, and partly of mineral particles
identical with the volcanic elements of the red clay.

  Regarding the composition and significance of the Globigerina ooze, see
  John Murray (L. N. 27, pp. 523-525, and L. N. 53, vol. i. p. 919).
  Recently this author has separated from the Globigerina ooze (_sensu
  stricto_), the _Pteropod ooze_, distinguished from the former by the
  greater abundance of Pteropod shells and calcareous shells of larger
  pelagic organisms which it contains. It is found in moderate depths (at
  most 1500 fathoms), and contains fewer Radiolaria.


239. _Red Clay._--This is quantitatively the most important of all deep-sea
deposits, covering by far the greatest extent of the three great ocean
basins at depths greater than 2200 fathoms. It thus far surpasses in area
the other deposits, both Radiolaria and Globigerina oozes, and commonly
forms a still deeper layer beneath them. Probably these three deep-sea
deposits together cover about three-eighths of the whole surface of the
earth, that is, about as much as all the continents together, whilst only
two-eighths are covered by the terrigenous deposits. Red clay is
principally composed of silicate of alumina, mixed in various proportions
with other finely granular substances; its usual red colour, which
sometimes passes over into grey or brown, is more especially due to
admixture of oxides of iron and manganese. Calcareous matter is usually
entirely wanting, or present only in traces, whilst free silica is found in
very variable, often considerable quantities. The chief mass of the red
clay consists of volcanic ashes, pumice, fragments of lava, &c., whilst a
large part of it is generally composed of shells of Radiolaria or fragments
of {clix}them; in many places the number of well-preserved skeletons
contained in the red clay is very considerable, so that it passes over
gradually into the Radiolarian ooze (_e.g._, in the North Pacific, Stations
238 to 253, see § 237). Hence it may be supposed that a large part of the
red clay consists of decomposed Radiolarian ooze.

  The characteristic composition and fundamental significance of the red
  clay in the formation of the deep-sea bed were first made known by the
  discoveries of the Challenger (compare John Murray, 1876, L. N. 27, p.
  527, and Narr. Chall. Exp., L. N. 53, vol. i. pt. ii. pp. 920-926, pl. N;
  also Wyville Thomson, The Atlantic, L. N. 31, vol. i. pp. 226-229).  The
  mineral components of the red clay are for the most part of volcanic
  origin, due to the decomposition of pumice, lava, &c. Among the organic
  remains found in it, the siliceous skeletons of Radiolaria are by far the
  most important, and their number is often considerable. A large portion
  of the red clay appears to me to consist of broken down Radiolarian
  shells, in which a peculiar metamorphism probably has taken place. Sir
  Wyville Thomson was of opinion that a considerable proportion of it
  consisted of the remains of Globigerina ooze, the calcareous constituents
  of which had been removed by the carbon dioxide in the deep-sea water (L.
  N. 31, _loc. cit._). Among these remains, however, the siliceous
  skeletons of the Radiolaria play a significant and often the most
  important part. Furthermore, John Murray has called attention to the fact
  that in many deep-sea deposits yellow and red insoluble particles remain,
  which unmistakably present the form of Radiolarian shells (L. N. 27, p.
  513). At Station 303 he found "amorphous clayey matter, rounded yellow
  minerals, many Radiolaria-shaped;" at Station 302 there was sediment
  "consisting almost entirely of small rounded red mineral particles; many
  of these had the form of both Foraminifera and Radiolaria; and it seemed
  as if some substance had been deposited in and on these organisms."
  Similar transitions from well-preserved Radiolarian shells into amorphous
  mineral particles I have found in several other specimens of Challenger
  soundings, and consider them a further argument for the supposition that
  the Radiolaria often take an important share in the formation of the red
  clay.


240. _List of Stations at which Radiolaria were observed on the Challenger
Expedition._--The 168 Stations recorded below, in soundings or surface
preparations from which I found Radiolaria, belong to the most various
parts of the sea which the Challenger traversed during her voyage round the
world; they constitute about half of the (364) observing Stations contained
in the official list published in the Narrative of the Cruise (Narr. Chall.
Exp., vol. i. part ii. Appendix ii.).

  In addition to the particulars given in the list regarding the
  geographical position of the Station, depth, temperature, and composition
  of the bottom deposit, I have added the result of my investigations as
  regards the relative abundance of the Radiolaria in each. The five
  letters (A to E) denote the following degrees of frequency:--A, abundant
  Radiolaria (AI, pure Radiolarian ooze; AII, mixed Radiolarian ooze); B,
  very numerous Radiolaria (but not a predominating quantity); C, many
  Radiolaria (medium quantity); D, few Radiolaria; E, very few Radiolaria
  (as they occur almost always). In using these symbols regard has been had
  to abundance of the abyssal as well as of the zonarial and pelagic forms
  (§ 232); sometimes also the estimated number of Radiolaria has been
  inserted, based upon information given by John Murray in his Preliminary
  Report (L. N. 27), and in the Narrative of the Cruise (L. N. 53), as well
  as by Henry B. Brady in his Report on the {clx}Foraminifera (Zool. Chall.
  Exp., part xxii., 1884). From Stations 348 to 352 in the Eastern Tropical
  Atlantic no specimens of the bottom were obtained, but a rich pelagic
  Radiolarian fauna was demonstrated by numerous preparations from the
  surface. The depths are given in fathoms and the temperature in degrees
  Fahrenheit. In the column describing the nature of the bottom the
  following abbreviations are used:--

{clxiv}CHAPTER X.--GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.

(§§ 241-250.)

241. _Historical Distribution._--Radiolaria are found fossil in all the
more important groups of the sedimentary rocks of the earth's crust. Whilst
a few years ago their well-preserved siliceous skeletons were only known in
considerable quantity from Cainozoic marls (§ 242), very many SPUMELLARIA
and NASSELLARIA have recently been found in Mesozoic and a few in Palæozoic
strata. By the aid of improved modern methods of investigation (especially
by the preparation of thin sections of very hard rocks) it has been shown
that many hard siliceous minerals, especially cryptocrystalline quartz,
contain numerous well-preserved Radiolaria, and sometimes are mainly
composed of closely compacted masses of such siliceous shells; of this kind
are many quartzites of the Jura (§ 243). These Jurassic quartzes
(Switzerland), as well as the Tertiary marls (Barbados) and clays (Nicobar
Islands), are to be regarded as "fossil Radiolarian ooze" (§ 237). Dense
masses of compressed SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA form the principal part of
these rocks. Isolated or in smaller quantities, fossil Polycystina,
belonging to different families of SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, also occur
in in other rocks, and even in some of Palæozoic origin. Since specimens
have also been recently found both in Silurian and Cambrian strata, it may
be stated that as regards their historical distribution, Radiolaria occur
in all fossiliferous sedimentary deposits, from the oldest to those of the
present time.


242. _Cainozoic Radiolaria._--The great majority of fossil Radiolaria which
have hitherto been described, belong to the Cainozoic or Tertiary period,
and in fact, to its middle portion, the Miocene period. At this period the
richest and most important of all the Radiolarian formations were
deposited, such as the pure "Polycystine marl" of Barbados (see note A),
also that of Grotte in Sicily (see note B), and the clay of the Nicobar
Islands (see note C). Besides the above-mentioned deposits, which may be
designated "pure" fossil Radiolarian ooze, many deposits containing these
organisms have recently been discovered in widely separated parts of the
earth, partly of the nature of tripoli or marl, partly resembling clay.
Among these may be mentioned in the first place many coasts and islands of
the Mediterranean, both on the south coast of Europe (Sicily, Calabria,
Greece), and the north coast of Africa (from Oran to Tripoli). The
extensive layers of tripoli which are found in these Mediterranean Tertiary
mountains belong to the upper Miocene (Tortona stage), and consist partly
of marl rich in calcareous matter, and resembling chalk, partly passing
over into plastic clay or "Kieselguhr" (§ 246). The quantity of Radiolaria
contained varies, and is more conspicuous the fewer the calcareous shells
of Foraminifera present. Similar Tertiary Polycystine formations occur in
some parts of America (see note D); probably they have a very wide
distribution. In their general morphological characters, the Tertiary
SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA {clxv}are related to those forms which are
found in the recent Radiolarian ooze of the depths of the Pacific,
especially to the species which are characteristic of the Challenger
Stations 225, 226, 265 and 268. Many living genera and families (_e.g._,
most #Larcoidea# and #Stephoidea#) have not yet been found in the Tertiary
formations.

  A. The famous Polycystine marl of Barbados in the Antilles, which Robert
  Schomburgk discovered forty years ago, belongs to the Miocene formation,
  and is the richest and best known of all the important Radiolarian
  deposits (see L. N. 16, pp. 5-8). After Ehrenberg had published in
  December 1846 the first preliminary communication regarding its
  composition out of masses of well-preserved Polycystina, he was able in
  the following year to describe no less than 282 species from it; he
  distributed these in 44 genera and 7 families (L. N. 4, 1847, p. 54). In
  the year 1854 Ehrenberg published figures of 33 species in his
  Mikrogeologie (L. N. 6,  Taf. xxxvi.); but it was only in 1873 that he
  published descriptions of 265 species (Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad. d.
  Wiss. Berlin, Jan. 30, pp. 213-263). Finally there followed in 1875 his
  Fortsetzung der Mikrogeologischen Studien, mit specieller Rücksicht auf
  den Polycystinen-Mergel von Barbados (L. N. 25). On the thirty plates
  which accompany this the last work of Ehrenberg, 282 species are figured
  and named, of which 54 are SPUMELLARIA (13 #Sphæroidea#, 8 #Prunoidea#,
  33 #Discoidea#), and 228 NASSELLARIA (2 #Stephoidea#, 38 #Spyroidea#, and
  188 #Cyrtoidea#). The fourth section of this memoir contains a survey of
  the Polycystine formation of Barbados (pp. 106-115), and the fifth
  section the special description of a large specimen of rock from Mount
  Hillaby in Barbados (see also L. N. 28, p. 117, and L. N. 41, pp.
  476-478). The account given by Ehrenberg of the Polycystina of Barbados
  is in many respects very incomplete, and very far from exhausting this
  rich mine of remarkable forms. This may be readily seen from the
  twenty-five plates of figures of Polycystins in the Barbados Chalk
  Deposit published by Bury in 1862 (L. N. 17). The number of species here
  figured (140 to 142) is about half of those given by Ehrenberg; and there
  are among them numerous generic types, some of great interest, which were
  entirely overlooked by the latter; _e.g._ _Saturnalis_ (#Sphæroidea#),
  _Cannartidium_ (#Prunoidea#), _Tympanidium_ (#Stephoidea#),
  _Cinclopyramis_ (#Cyrtoidea#), &c. Finally, Ehrenberg always (until 1875)
  ignored Bury's atlas, which had been published thirteen years ago and was
  quite accessible to him. How different were the contents of the two works
  may easily be seen from the following abstract.

  {clxvi}In 1882 Bütschli still further increased the number of known
  Radiolaria from Barbados both by figures and descriptions (L. N. 40), and
  gave in particular a very accurate morphological analysis of 12 new
  NASSELLARIA (3 #Stephoidea#, 3 #Spyroidea#, and 6 #Cyrtoidea#; L. N. 40,
  Taf. xxxii., xxxiii.). The number of the fossil species collected in the
  Barbados marl is, however, greater than would appear from the
  above-quoted communications. My respected friend, Dr. R. Teuscher, of
  Jena, has, at my request, made a large number (about a thousand) of very
  accurate drawings with the camera lucida of Polycystina from Barbados
  (see p. 1760). From these it appears that the variations in the structure
  of the shells, with respect to number, size, and form of the
  lattice-pores, of the spines, &c., is much greater than would be supposed
  from the figures of Ehrenberg and Bury. I have thus come to the
  conviction that the number of species from Barbados (using the word
  "species" in the sense understood by those authors) is not less than 400
  and probably more than 500. Descriptions of some particularly interesting
  new species from this series have been included in the systematic account
  of the Challenger Radiolaria. A complete critical investigation of the
  Radiolaria of Barbados, and especially an accurate comparison of these
  Cainozoic species with the Mesozoic forms from the Jura, on the one hand,
  and with recent types on the other, must be left to the future for its
  accomplishment (see § 246).

  B. The Cainozoic Polycystine tripoli or marl of the Mediterranean coast,
  which is probably always of Miocene origin, forms very extensive mountain
  ranges both in the south of Europe (Sicily, Calabria, Greece) and in the
  north of Africa (from Oran to Tripoli) (§ 246). Hitherto, however, only
  one locality has been thoroughly investigated, namely, Grotte in the
  province of Girgenti in Sicily (L. N. 35). In the accurate account which
  was given of it by Stöhr in 1880, 118 species were described, distributed
  in 40 genera (L. N. 35; pp. 72-84); of these 118 species 78 are quite
  new, 25 are identical with previously known fossils, and 29 identical
  with living forms. Among them are 73 SPUMELLARIA (28 #Sphæroidea#, 8
  #Prunoidea#, and 37 #Discoidea#), but only 40 NASSELLARIA (1
  #Stephoidea#, 6 #Spyroidea#, and 33 #Cyrtoidea#), and 5 PHÆODARIA
  (Dictyochida). The other parts of Sicily from which the same upper
  Miocene tripoli has been investigated (belonging to the Tortona stage)
  have proved less rich than Grotte. The best known of these places is
  Caltanisetta, since upon three genera discovered here (_Haliomma_,
  _Cornutella_, _Lithocampe_) the group Polycystina was founded by
  Ehrenberg in 1838 (see L. N. 16, p. 3). Afterwards 31 species were
  described from this locality, of which 23 were again found in Grotte. The
  richest deposit on the Mediterranean coast, however, appears to be at
  Oran. A small specimen of the Kieselguhr found there, which was recently
  sent to me by Professor Steinman, proved to be pure Radiolarian ooze,
  very similar to that now found in the Central Pacific, and contained many
  hitherto undescribed species; it is deserving of careful investigation
  and comparison.

  C. Regarding the Tertiary Radiolarian clay of the Nicobar Islands, see §
  247 and L. N. 25, pp. 116-120. Its fauna is incompletely known; probably
  it is of Miocene or Oligocene origin.

  D. Cainozoic tripoli, containing larger or smaller quantities of
  Radiolaria, appears to be rather widely distributed in America. Ehrenberg
  has described such from South America (polishing-slate from Morro di
  Mijellones, on the coast between Chili and Bolivia), and from North
  America (Richmond and Petersburg in Virginia, Piscataway in Maryland).
  Similar deposits are also found in the Bermuda Islands (L. N. 4, 1855-56;
  L. N. 6, Taf. 18; L. N. 16, pp. 3-9; L. N. 41, pp. 475-478, and L. N. 25,
  pp. 2-6).


{clxvii}243. _Mesozoic Radiolaria._--From the Mesozoic or Secondary period
numerous well-preserved Radiolaria have recently been described. They
belong for the most part to the Jurassic formation (see notes A, B, C),
whilst the more recent Chalk (see note D) and the older Trias (see note E)
have hitherto yielded but few species. All the main divisions of the Jura,
both the upper (Malm) and the middle (Dogger), and especially the lower
(Lias) appear in certain localities to be very rich in well-preserved
shells of fossil Polycystina. Most of these are aggregated together in
coprolites and quartzites (jasper, chert, flint, &c., § 248). The majority
are #Cyrtoidea#, the minority #Sphæroidea# and #Discoidea# in almost equal
proportions; a few #Beloidea# (_Sphærozoum_) and #Phæocystina# (Dictyocha)
are also found among them. The general morphological character of these
Jurassic Radiolaria is very different from that of the nearly related
Tertiary and living forms. In general, their siliceous shells are firmer
and more massive, usually also somewhat larger, but of simpler structure.
The manifold delicate appendages (spines, bristles, feet, wings, &c.) which
are so richly developed in the living SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, and are
also well shown in the Tertiary species, are entirely wanting in the
majority of the Jurassic Polycystina. The #Sphæroidea# and #Prunoidea# are
all simple spherical or ellipsoidal lattice-shells (Monosphærida);
concentric lattice-shells (Polysphærida) are entirely wanting. The
#Cyrtoidea# are, for the most part, devoid of radial processes or basal
feet (Eradiata); triradiate and multiradiate forms, such as are found
abundantly in the recent and Tertiary formations, are very rare. The large
number of many-jointed forms (Stichocyrtida) and of #Cyrtoidea# with
latticed basal opening is very striking.

  A. The most important work on the Jurassic Radiolaria, regarding which
  but little was known prior to the year 1885, is the valuable and in some
  respects very interesting Beiträge zur Kenntniss der fossilen Radiolarien
  aus Gesteinen des Jura, by Dr. Rüst of Freiburg i. B. (1885,
  Palæontographica, Bd. xxxi. 51 pp. with 12 plates). Unfortunately this
  important work was issued only when about half of the present Report was
  printed off, so that it was no longer possible to include the 234 species
  there described in its systematic part. I have therefore elsewhere given
  a list of the Jurassic Radiolaria, and at present only make the following
  remarks:--Of the 234 species described, the larger half (130) belong to
  the NASSELLARIA (#Cyrtoidea#), the smaller half (102) to the SPUMELLARIA
  (38 #Sphæroidea#, 14 #Prunoidea#, and 50 #Discoidea#). In addition, there
  are 2 PHÆODARIA depicted, and several spicules which are probably to be
  referred to the #Beloidea#. Among the 130 #Cyrtoidea# (of which 2 are
  described as #Botryodea#), there are 24 Monocyrtida, 14 Dicyrtida, 22
  Tricyrtida, and 70 Stichocyrtida. Just as striking as the predominant
  number of the last is the fact that there are only very few triradiate
  (9) and multiradiate (4) species found among these 130 #Cyrtoidea#, as
  also the large number of species with latticed basal opening;
  #Stephoidea# appear to be entirely wanting. The rich material of jasper,
  chert, flint, and coprolites in which Dr. Rüst found these Radiolaria, is
  derived for the most part from the Jurassic rocks of Germany (Hanover,
  South Bavaria), Tyrol, and Switzerland (compare § 248).

  {clxviii}B. Jurassic Radiolaria from Italy, also found in jasper, which
  are closely related to the forms from Germany and Switzerland described
  by Dr. Rüst, were made known so long ago as 1880 by Dante Pantanelli in
  his treatise I Diaspri della Toscana e i loro Fossili (Rome, 1880, 33 pp.
  60 figs.). Pantanelli believes, however, that this jasper is for the most
  part of Eocene origin; but from his description, and especially from the
  morphological character of the forms which he figures, it appears very
  probable "that these Tuscan jaspers from Galestro, like those of the
  Swiss conglomerates, are found in a secondary locality and belong to the
  Jurassic period" (Rüst, L. N. 51, p. 3). Unfortunately the figures of
  Pantanelli are so small and incomplete that a reliable determination of
  the species is hardly possible; for example, the lattice-work is only
  given in ten of the sixty figures. Among the 32 recorded species 15 are
  SPUMELLARIA (6 #Sphæroidea# and 9 #Discoidea#) and 17 NASSELLARIA (4
  #Stephoidea# and 13 #Cyrtoidea#); many of which seem to be identical with
  the forms more accurately described by Dr. Rüst (compare p. 1762).

  C. From the Lias of the Alps and more particularly "from the lower
  Liassic beds of the Schafberg near Salzburg," Dr. Emil von Dunikowski in
  1882 described 18 species of fossil Radiolaria (L. N. 44, pp. 22-34, Taf.
  iv.-vi.); most of these are #Sphæroidea# and #Discoidea# and appear to
  have been more or less altered by petrological changes; their spongy
  structure is probably secondary.

  D. Cretaceous Radiolaria have been hitherto described only in very small
  numbers; quite recently Dr. Rüst has found a larger number chiefly in
  flints from the English chalk, but they have not yet been published. In
  1876 Zittel described 6 very well-preserved species from the upper chalk
  of North Germany (L. N. 29, pp. 76-96, Taf. ii.); among them were 1
  #Sphæroidea#, 1 #Discoidea#, 1 Dictyocha, and 3 #Cyrtoidea#.

  E. Triassic Radiolaria have recently been discovered by Dr. Rüst in
  chert, but have not yet been described.


244. _Palæozoic Radiolaria._--The number of Radiolaria which are known from
the Palæozoic or Primary formations is much less than from either the
Mesozoic or Cainozoic periods. Here, however, the investigations of recent
times have yielded important information; a few species, at all events, of
Polycystina (mostly #Sphæroidea#) are now known from various Palæozoic
formations, and not only from the Permian ("Zechstein") and the
Coal-measures, but also from the older Devonian and Silurian systems. Even
in the still older Cambrian rocks a few fossil Radiolaria have been found.
All these Palæozoic Radiolaria are Polycystina of very simple form and
primitive structure, mostly simple SPUMELLARIA (latticed spheres,
ellipsoids, lenses, &c.), but partly also simple NASSELLARIA.

  The important discoveries which have recently been made by Dr. Rüst
  regarding the occurrence of Radiolaria in all the Palæozoic formations
  have not yet been published. From conversations with this estimable
  palæontologist I have learned, however, that he has pursued his fruitful
  investigation of the Mesozoic quartzites (§ 243), and has met with no
  less success in the case of similar Palæozoic structures. Although the
  number of species hitherto discovered is relatively small, the important
  conclusion appears to be warranted that they extend as far as the
  Silurian and Cambrian systems. All these very ancient SPUMELLARIA
  (#Sphæroidea#) and NASSELLARIA (#Cyrtoidea#) {clxix}exhibit very
  primitive structural relations. The occurrence of fossil Polycystina in
  the Carboniferous formation of England has been incidentally mentioned by
  W. J. Sollas:--"In the carboniferous beds of North Wales pseudomorphs of
  Radiolaria in calcite occur, along with minute quartz crystals" (Ann. and
  Mag. Nat. Hist., 1880, ser. 5, vol. vi. p. 439); and in the siliceous
  slate-beds of Saxony Rothpletz has shown the existence of a few
  #Sphæroidea# (Zeitschr. d. Deutsch. Geol. Gesellsch., 1800, p. 447).


245. _Abundance of Radiolaria in the Various Rocks._--The relative quantity
of well-preserved or at all events recognisable Radiolaria in the different
rocks is very variable. In this respect three different degrees may be
distinguished, which may be called shortly "pure, mixed, and poor"
Radiolarian formations. The _pure_ Radiolarian rocks consist for the
greater part (usually much more than half, sometimes even more than
three-quarters) of closely compacted often calcined masses of siliceous
Polycystine shells. To this category belong the pure Miocene Polycystine
marls of Barbados (§ 246), the Tertiary Polycystine clay of the Nicobar
Islands (§ 247), and the Polycystine quartz of the Jura (§ 248). All these
pure Radiolarian rocks may be regarded as fossil Radiolarian ooze (§ 237),
and are certainly of deep-sea origin, having probably been deposited at
depths greater than 2000 fathoms. Their palæontological character also is
in favour of this view, for the abyssal Osculosa (§ 235) are more abundant
and richer in species than the pelagic Porulosa (§ 233). The elevation of
this deep-sea layer above the surface of the sea appears to have taken
place but seldom; it has only been observed on a large scale at Barbados
and in the Nicobar Islands. The _mixed_ Radiolarian rocks are much more
common; they were probably deposited at much less depths, or perhaps are
not true deep-sea formations at all. The siliceous shells of Polycystina
always constitute less than half (sometimes less than one-tenth) of their
mass, and are less prominent than other siliceous remains (Diatoms), or
calcareous remains (Foraminifera), or in some cases than the mineral
constituents (pumice, &c.). To this group belong many of the
above-mentioned Tertiary marls and clays (especially the Mediterranean
Tripoli), also many flints, cherts, and other quartzites from Mesozoic
strata (especially from the Jura), and probably also some palæozoic
quartzites. The marine ooze from which they have originated may have been
deposited at very various, even at slight, depths of the ocean. Formations
_poor_ in Radiolaria, which contain only a few species of SPUMELLARIA and
NASSELLARIA mingled with other fossil remains and mineral particles, occur
in all formations and are probably very widely distributed. Further careful
examination of thin sections (especially of coprolites) will yield here a
rich harvest of new forms. Both the mixed and the pure Radiolarian
formations may be divided according to their petrographic characters into
three groups, which, however, are connected by intermediate varieties--(1)
soft, chalky marl (§ 246), (2) plastic clay (§ 247), and (3) hard, flinty
quartz (§ 248).


{clxx}246. _Radiolarian Marl._--Those soft, friable rocks, which contain a
large quantity of calcareous matter, but consist for the most part of the
shells of SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA, are called Radiolarian or
Polycystine marl, often more correctly Polycystine tripoli; the best known
example of them is the chalky marl of Barbados in the Antilles (§ 242). The
Tertiary mountain system of this island, which in Mount Hillaby rises to a
height of 1147 feet and includes about 15,800 acres, consists almost
exclusively of these remarkable masses of rock. Most of it appears as a
soft, earthy, often chalky marl, with a considerable but variable amount of
calcareous matter. Those specimens, the greater half of which is composed
of well-preserved siliceous shells of Polycystina, and which contain little
lime, approach the tripoli and "Kieselguhr." Those specimens, however,
which contain the largest amount of calcareous matter resemble common
writing chalk in consistency, and consist for the most part of shells of
Foraminifera and their fragments; of these there are only few species but
large numbers of individuals, generally in small fragments with a fine
calcareous powder between them. They may be regarded as fossil Globigerina
ooze (§ 238). In a third group of specimens from Barbados the quantity of
fragments of pumice and other volcanic matters predominates; the amount of
clay is also very considerable; these deposits pass over partly into actual
clay partly into volcanic tuff. A fourth group exhibits relations to a
coarser often ferruginous material, and although the shells of Polycystina
are less abundant in it, still it may be shown to be composed largely of
fragments and metamorphosed remains of them. The colour of this deposit,
which in some places passes over into sandstone, in others into clay, is
usually rather dark, grey, brown, sometimes red and occasionally black
(bituminous). The Radiolarian marls of the first two groups, which
sometimes approach the white chalk, sometimes the Kieselguhr, are grey, or
even pure white (see note A). The same constitution is exhibited by the
yellowish or white, very light and friable Polycystine marls of Sicily,
which in Caltanisetta approach the chalk, and in Grotte the Kieselguhr. In
Greece (Ægina, Zante, &c.), on the other hand, they pass over into plastic
clay, and the same occurs in the Baden marl of the Vienna basin. In North
Africa, however, on the Mediterranean shores of which the Radiolarian marl
seems to be very widely distributed (from Tripoli to Oran), it sometimes
becomes changed into actual firm polishing slate, sometimes into
pulverulent Kieselguhr or tripoli (Terra tripolitana, see note B). Most of
these Radiolarian marls appear to date from the middle Tertiary (Miocene)
period, and to be deep-sea formations.

  A. The Polycystine marl of Barbados appears at different parts of the
  island to present greater variations in its petrographical and
  zoographical composition than would appear from Ehrenberg's description
  (1875, L. N. 25, pp. 106-116). Through the kindness of one of my former
  students, Dr. Dorner, to whom I take this opportunity of expressing my
  thanks for the favour, I received a large number of specimens of Barbados
  rock, taken from various parts of the island, and they exhibit very great
  variations in their external appearance, their chemical composition, and
  the {clxxi}Radiolaria which they contain. The white specimens resembling
  Kieselguhr contained approximately 60 to 70 per cent. by volume of
  Radiolarian shells, the yellowish marl 40 to 50 per cent., and the brown
  and black (bituminous) marl 10 to 20 per cent. or less. Two analyses of
  the first, which my friend Dr. W. Weber was good enough to carry out,
  yielded different results from those which are given by Ehrenberg on the
  basis of Rammelsberg's analyses (L. N. 25, p. 116). The results of both
  are here given for comparison.

  B. The Radiolarian marl of the Mediterranean appears, judging by the
  accounts already published, to stretch along a considerable part of the
  coast in the earlier and middle Tertiary formations; thus it occurs of
  similar composition in widely separated localities, in Sicily, Calabria,
  Zante, and Greece; in North Africa from Tripoli to Oran and probably much
  farther. So long ago as 1854 Ehrenberg, in his Mikrogeologie (L. N. 6)
  gave a series of important, even if incomplete, communications regarding
  the "chalky white calcareous marl of Caltanisetta" (Taf. xxii.), the
  "Platten marl of Zante" (Taf. xx.), the "plastic clay of Ægina" (Taf
  xix.), and the "polishing slate of Oran" (Taf. xxi.). In 1880 Stöhr
  showed in his fundamental description of the Tripoli from {clxxii}Grotte
  in Sicily (L. N. 35) that its Radiolarian fauna is much richer than
  Ehrenberg supposed. The same is the case in the Tripoli of Caltanisetta,
  and also in the Baden marl of the Vienna basin. The richest deposit
  appears to be the pure Kieselguhr-like Tripoli from Oran; a small
  specimen, which was recently sent to me by Professor Steinmann of
  Freiburg, i. B., contained many hitherto undescribed species, and was at
  least as rich as the purest Barbados marl.


247. _Radiolarian Clays._--Among the Radiolarian or Polycystine clays we
include the firm, often plastic, formations, which contain a larger
proportion of Radiolaria than of other organic remains. The first of these
to be mentioned is the Cainozoic formation of the Nicobar Islands in
Further India, which rises to a height of 2000 feet above the level of the
sea, and consists for the most part of coloured masses of clay of varying
constitution; on Car Nicobar these are mostly grey or reddish, on the
Island of Camorta they are partly strongly ferruginous and red and yellow
(_e.g._ at Frederickshaven), partly white and light, like meerschaum
(_e.g._ at Mongkata). The latter varieties appear to pass over into pure
loose Polycystine marl like that of Barbados, the former into calcareous
sandstone. Although the Polycystine clays of the Nicobar Islands are as yet
only very incompletely known, it may be concluded with great probability
that they are true deep-sea formations and nearly allied to those recent
forms of red clay, which by their abundance in Radiolaria most nearly
approach the Radiolarian ooze, such for example as the red clay of the
North Pacific between Japan and the Sandwich Islands (Stations 241 to 245,
compare §§ 229 and 239). With this view agrees also the greater or less
quantity of pumice dust and other volcanic products. Probably Radiolarian
clays like those of the Nicobar Islands occur also in other Tertiary rocks;
part of the Barbados marl passes by gradually increasing content of clay
into such; and in this case also the amount of included pumice is often
considerable. Many mixed Radiolarian marls of the Mediterranean (_e.g._, of
Greece and Oran) also appear to pass over at certain points into
Radiolarian clay.

  The Radiolarian clays of the Nicobar Islands are unfortunately very
  incompletely known both as regards their geological nature and their
  palæontological composition. The communications of Rink (Die
  Nikobaren-Inseln, eine geographische Skizze, Kopenhagen, 1847) and of
  Ehrenberg (L. N. 6, p. 160 and L. N. 25, pp. 116 to 120) leave many
  important questions unanswered. The latter has only figured twenty-three
  species in his Mikrogeologie (L. N. 6, Taf. xxxvi.). In his tabular list
  of names (L. N. 25, p. 120) he only incompletely records thirty-nine
  species, although in 1850, immediately after the first examination of the
  Nicobar clay, he had distinguished "more than a hundred species, partly
  new, partly identical with those of Barbados" (L. N. 16, p. 8). I have
  unfortunately been unable in spite of many efforts, to obtain for
  investigation a specimen of Nicobar clay. The only microscopical
  preparation (from Ehrenberg's collection), which I was able to examine,
  contained several hitherto undescribed species. A thorough systematic
  examination of these important Radiolarian clays is a pressing necessity,
  especially as they seem to be markedly different from those of the
  Mediterranean (from Ægina, Zante, &c.).


{clxxiii}248. _Radiolarian Quartzes._--Under the name Radiolarian or
Polycystine quartzes are included those hard, siliceous rocks, which
consist for the most part of the closely compacted shells of SPUMELLARIA
and NASSELLARIA. To these "cryptocrystalline quartzes," or better,
quartzites, belong more especially the pure Radiolarian formations of the
Jura, which have been described as flint, chert, jasper, as well as other
cryptocrystalline quartzites. Most of the rocks of this nature hitherto
examined are from Germany (Hanover, South Bavaria), Hungary, Tyrol, and
Switzerland; others are known from Italy (Tuscany). They occur both in the
upper and middle, but especially in the lower Jurassic formation (also in
the lower layers of the Alpine Lias). A small part of them has been
examined in their primary situation (the red jaspers of Allgäu and Tyrol),
the greater part, however, only as loose rolled stones in secondary
situations (thus in Switzerland in the breccia of the Rigi, in the
conglomerate of the Uetli-Berg, and in many boulders of the Rhine, the
Limmat, the Reuss, and the Aar). The greatest abundance, however, of
Jurassic Radiolaria has been yielded by the silicified coprolites from the
Lias of Hanover. These "Radiolarian coprolites" are roundish or cylindrical
bodies, which may attain the size of a goose-egg; they probably originated
from Fish or Cephalopods, which had fed upon Crustacea, Pteropoda, and
similar pelagic organisms, whose stomachs were already full of Radiolarian
skeletons. Next to the coprolites the richest is the red jasper, whose
colour varies from bright to dark red; it constitutes a true "silicified
deep-sea Radiolarian ooze." The "_Aptychus_ beds" also of South Bavaria and
Tyrol are very rich, and have furnished about one-third of all the
Radiolaria known from the Jura; most of the species too are very well
preserved (compare § 243).

  Regarding the remarkable composition and manifold varieties of the
  Jurassic Radiolarian quartz, the very full treatise of Dr. Rüst may be
  consulted (L. N. 51). The very interesting Radiolarian coprolites, which
  that author has discovered in the lower and middle Jura of Hanover, occur
  in astonishing numbers in the iron mines at the village of Gross-Ilsede,
  four and a half miles south of the town of Peine. They constitute from 2
  to 5 per cent. by weight of the Liassic iron ore; of this latter, in the
  year 1883 alone, not less than two hundred and eighty million kilograms
  were excavated. It is very probable that the careful microscopic
  examination of thin sections of coprolites, as well as of flints, chert,
  jasper, and other quartzites, would yield a rich harvest of fossil
  Radiolaria in other formations also. In Italy Dante Pantanelli has
  discovered interesting Polycystine jaspers in Tuscany (L. N. 36, 45);
  these also appear to occur in the Jura (compare § 243, and L. N. 51, pp.
  3-10).


249. _Fossil Groups._--The preservation of Radiolaria in the fossil state
is, of course, primarily dependent on the composition of their skeleton.
Hence the ACANTHARIA, whose acanthin skeleton although firm is readily
soluble, are never found fossil. The same is true of the skeletons of the
PHÆODARIA, which consist of a silicate of carbon; here, however, a single
exception is found in the Dictyochida, a subfamily of the Cannorrhaphida,
the isolated parts of whose skeletons appear to consist of pure silica, and
{clxxiv}are often found fossil. Of the two other legions those families
which possess no skeleton are of course excluded; the Nassellida among the
NASSELLARIA, and the Thalassicollida and Collozoida among the SPUMELLARIA.
Thus of the 85 known families there remain scarcely 55 of which the
skeletons may be expected in the fossil state; and of these scarcely half
have been actually observed in this condition. Of the 20 orders of this
class enumerated in § 155, the following 9 may be, for palæontological and
geological purposes, completely excluded:--(A) The 4 orders of ACANTHARIA
(1, #Actinelida#; 2, #Acanthonida#; 3, #Sphærophracta#; 4, #Prunophracta#);
(B) 3 orders of PHÆODARIA (5, #Phæosphæria#; 6, #Phæogromia#; 7,
#Phæoconchia#); (C) 1 order of NASSELLARIA (8, #Nassoidea#); (D) 1 order of
SPUMELLARIA (9, #Colloidea#). From a geological point of view the following
6 orders, although occasionally found fossil, are of quite subordinate
importance:--(A) Among the SPUMELLARIA (10, #Beloidea#, and 11,
#Larcoidea#); (B) among the NASSELLARIA (12, #Plectoidea#; 13,
#Stephoidea#; 14, #Botryodea#); (C) among the PHÆODARIA (15, the
#Phæocystina#). On the other hand the following 5 orders, which are the
main constituents of Radiolarian rocks, are of pre-eminent geological
importance:--(A) Among the SPUMELLARIA (16, #Sphæroidea#; 17, #Prunoidea#;
18, #Discoidea#); (B) among the NASSELLARIA (19, #Spyroidea#, and 20,
#Cyrtoidea#). The numerical relation in which the different families of
these orders appear in the Radiolarian formations may be seen on consulting
§ 157.


250. _Fossil and Recent Species._--The fact that there are many Radiolaria
living at the present day, whose shells are found fossil in Tertiary rocks,
is of great phylogenetic and geological significance. This appeared to be
the case even from the older observations upon the Polycystina of the
Barbados marl (see note A), but more recent and extensive observations both
upon these and upon the Miocene Radiolaria of Sicily, have shown that the
number of these "living fossil" forms is much greater than was previously
supposed (see note B). Among the Miocene Radiolaria numerous species, both
of SPUMELLARIA (especially #Sphæroidea# and #Discoidea#) and of NASSELLARIA
(especially #Spyroidea# and #Cyrtoidea#) are not to be distinguished from
the corresponding still living forms (see notes C, D). On the other hand,
those genera, which are rich both in species and individuals (recent as
well as fossil), present continuous series of forms which lead gradually
and uninterruptedly from old Tertiary species to others still living, which
are specifically indistinguishable from them. These interesting
morphological facts are capable of direct phylogenetic application, and
furnish valuable proofs of the truth of the theory of descent.

  A. Ehrenberg, in his list of fossil Polycystina (L. N. 25, pp. 64-85,
  1875), records 325 species of which 26 are still living.

  {clxxv}B. Stöhr, in his list of Miocene Radiolaria from Grotte (L. N. 35,
  p. 84, 1880), records 118 species, of which 29 are still living.

  C. Teuscher, who at my request has made a large number of comparative
  measurements and drawings, both of fossil and living Radiolaria, comes to
  the conclusion that numerous SPUMELLARIA and NASSELLARIA from Barbados
  are to-day extant and unchanged in the Radiolarian ooze of the deep
  Pacific Ocean (compare § 242A, and p. 1760, Note).

  D. From the comparative investigations, which I have made during the last
  ten years into the recent deep-sea Radiolaria of the Challenger
  collection and the Miocene Polycystina of Barbados, it appears that about
  a quarter of the latter are identical with living species of the former.

252. _Progress of our Knowledge of the Radiolaria from_ 1862 _to_
1885.--The history of our scientific knowledge of the Radiolaria extends
over about half a century (from 1834 to 1885). A historical and critical
discussion of the works which appeared within the first twenty-eight years
of this period (from 1834 to 1862) is contained in the historical
introduction to my Monograph (L. N. 16, pp. 1-24); I shall therefore
give here only a brief survey of the investigations published during
the last twenty-three years (from 1862 to 1885). The most important
steps in our progress during this period we owe to the following
naturalists:--Cienkowski (1871), Ehrenberg (1872 and 1875), Richard Hertwig
(1876 and 1879), Karl Brandt (1881 and 1885), Bütschli (1882), and Rüst
(1885). To the valuable works of these authors must be added a number of
smaller contributions, which are recorded in the foregoing Bibliography.
Some communications from dilettanti, written with insufficient knowledge of
the subject, and hence of no value, are mentioned for the sake of
completeness in the "Phaulographic Appendix" (compare L. N. 55-60, also L.
N. 26, p. 9).

The first important advance in our knowledge of the organisation of the
Radiolaria, made after the publication of my Monograph (1862), was the
demonstration of the nature of the extracapsular "yellow cells." In the
year 1870 I showed that these yellow cells contain starch (L. N. 21, p.
519). I regarded them, as did all authors up to that time, as integral
parts of the Radiolarian organism, and hence considered this to be
multicellular; for no doubt was possible regarding the true cellular nature
of these remarkable, nucleated, yellow globules, which I had thoroughly
studied in 1862. It was first shown by Cienkowski in 1871 that the yellow
cells of the #Collodaria# remain unchanged even after the death of these
organisms, "that they continue to grow uninterruptedly, and eventually
multiply by division" (L. N. 22, pp. 378-380, Taf. xix. figs. 30-36).
Cienkowski concluded from these important observations that the yellow
cells are not integral parts of the Radiolarian body, but "parasitic
structures," independent, unicellular organisms, which live only as
parasites in the body of the Radiolaria (compare § 90).

This important recognition underwent ten years later a further development
and complete establishment by the extensive investigations of Karl Brandt
(L. N. 38, 39) {clxxx}and Patrick Geddes (L. N. 42, 43). This arrangement
was compared by Brandt to the remarkable symbiosis of the Algoid gonidia
and Fungoid hyphæ in the organisation of the Lichens, which had been
recently discovered, and since he recognised the independent nature of the
yellow cells, as unicellular Algæ, in all divisions of the Radiolaria, he
founded for them the genus _Zooxanthella_. Geddes named them _Philozoon_,
and showed experimentally that they give out oxygen under the influence of
sunlight (compare § 90). The great physiological importance of the yellow
cells in the metastasis of the Radiolaria, and, when they are developed in
large quantities, in the economy of marine organisms in general, has
recently been insisted upon by Brandt (see § 205 and L. N. 52, pp. 65-71,
86-94).

The proof that the yellow cells do not belong to the Radiolarian organism
itself, but only live parasitically in it, was a necessary preliminary to
the very important step which next took place in our knowledge of the
organisation of the Radiolaria. This step consisted in the demonstration
that the whole body of the Radiolaria, like that of all other Protista, is
only a single cell. It was Richard Hertwig who in two remarkable works (L.
N. 26, 33) firmly established this fundamental theorem of the unicellular
nature of the Radiolaria. In his treatise on the histology of the
Radiolaria (L. N. 26, 1876) he published complete investigations into the
structure and development of the Sphærozoida and Thalassicollida. Since he
made use of the modern methods of histological examination, and especially
of staining fluids, which he was the first to apply to the study of the
Radiolaria, he was able to show that no true cells (apart from the
parasitic yellow cells) are to be found in their bodies, but rather that
all their morphological components are to be regarded as differentiated
parts of a single true cell, and in particular that the central capsule
includes a genuine nucleus.

A wider foundation for this important discovery and its applicability to
all divisions of this extensive class, was given by Hertwig in a second
work on the organisation of the Radiolaria (L. N. 33, 1879). Among the
numerous discoveries by which this work enriched the natural history of the
Radiolaria must be specially mentioned the recognition of the fundamental
differences exhibited by the main divisions of the class in the structure
of their central capsule. Hertwig first observed that the capsular membrane
is double in the PHÆODARIA but single in the other Radiolaria (§ 56); the
former he named "TRIPYLEA" because he discovered in their capsular membrane
a large, peculiarly constructed main opening and two small accessory
openings. The NASSELLARIA, in which he found a single porous area at the
basal pole of the main axis, with a cone of pseudopodia rising from it, he
called on this account "MONOPYLEA"; whilst the other Radiolaria, whose
capsular membrane is perforated on all sides with fine pores, were termed
"PERIPYLEA." Besides the central capsule, Hertwig laid stress upon the
significance of the gelatinous envelope as a constant and important
constituent of the body. He also devoted attentive consideration to the
morphology of the skeleton, and on the basis of certain
{clxxxi}phylogenetic conclusions which he drew from it, he arrived at an
improved systematic arrangement in which he distinguished six orders:--(1)
#Thalassicollea#, (2) #Sphærozoea#, (3) #Peripylea#, (4) #Acanthometrea#,
(5) #Monopylea#, (6) #Tripylea#. The numerous isolated discoveries with
which Hertwig enriched the morphology of the Radiolaria, have been already
alluded to in the appropriate paragraphs in the anatomical portion of this
Introduction (see L. N. 42, pp. 340, 341).

The new and interesting group, which was thus erected into an order under
the name TRIPYLEA, I had already a year previously separated from the other
Radiolaria as "_Pansolenia_" in my Protistenreich (L. N. 32, p. 102).
Since, however, neither the three capsular openings of the TRIPYLEA nor the
skeletal tubes of the Pansolenia are present in all the families of this
extensive order, I substituted in 1879 the more suitable name PHÆODARIA,
which is applicable to all members of the group (L. N. 34). In the
preliminary memoir then published regarding the Phæodaria, a New Group of
Siliceous Marine Rhizopods, I distinguished four orders, ten families, and
thirty-eight genera. The great majority of these new forms (among which
were no less than 465 different species) were first discovered by the
deep-sea investigations of the Challenger. John Murray was the first who
called attention to the great abundance in the deep sea of these remarkable
Rhizopods, and to the constant presence of their peculiar, dark,
extracapsular pigment body (phæodium); even in 1876 he described a portion
of them as Challengerida (L. N. 27, p. 536; L. N. 53, p. 226). The earliest
observations on the PHÆODARIA were made at Messina in 1859, where I
examined five genera of this remarkable group alive (compare p. 1522 and L.
N. 16).

By the discovery that the PHÆODARIA, although differing in important
respects from the other Radiolaria, still conform to the definition of the
class, a new and extensive series of forms was added to this latter, and by
their closer investigation a fresh source of interesting morphological
problems was disclosed. In other groups, however, morphology was advanced
by comparative anatomical studies. In addition to the smaller contributions
of various authors, mentioned in the foregoing bibliography, I may
specially refer to the valuable Beiträge zur Kenntniss der
Radiolarien-Skelete, insbesondere der der Cyrtida by O. Bütschli (L. N. 40,
1882). On the basis of careful comparative anatomical studies,
investigations into the skeletal structure of a number of fossil
#Cyrtoidea# and critical application of the recently published researches
of Ehrenberg into the Polycystina of Barbados (L. N. 25), Bütschli
attempted to derive the complicated relations of the Monopylean skeletons
phylogenetically from a simple primitive form,--the primary sagittal ring.
Even if this attempt did not actually solve the very difficult
morphological problem in question, still the critical and synthetic mode in
which it was carried out deserves full recognition, and furnishes the proof
that the comparative anatomy of the skeleton in the Radiolaria not less
than in the Vertebrata, is a most interesting and fruitful field of
phylogenetic investigation. A {clxxxii}further demonstration of this was
furnished by Bütschli in the general account of the organisation of the
Radiolaria which he published in 1882 in Bronn's Klassen und Ordnungen des
Thierreichs (L. N. 41).

In our knowledge of the developmental history of these Protista the last
two decades have witnessed less progress than in their comparative anatomy.
The most important advance in this direction has been the proof that in all
the main groups of the class the contents of the central capsule are used
in the formation of swarm-spores. The movements of these zoospores in the
central capsule had indeed been observed by several previous authors in the
case of the SPUMELLARIA and ACANTHARIA (L. N. 10, 13, 16; compare also §
142, Note A). The origin of the flagellate spores from the contents of the
central capsule and their peculiar constitution were, however, first
described fully by Cienkowski in 1871 (L. N. 22, p. 372). Soon after this,
R. Hertwig discovered that in the social Radiolaria (Polycyttaria or
Sphærozoea) two different forms of zoospores are formed, one with, the
other without crystals, and that the latter are also divided into
macrospores and microspores (compare L. N. 26, and § 142). Recently this
sexual differentiation has been shown by Karl Brandt to exist in all the
groups of Sphærozoea, and its regular interchange with the formation of
crystal-spores has been interpreted as a true "alternation of generations"
(compare L. N. 52 and also § 216). The other forms of development also,
especially reproduction by cell-division (§ 213) and gemmation (§ 214),
have been elucidated by the recent investigations of the same author.

The palæontology of the Radiolaria has of late made important and
interesting advances. Until ten years ago fossil remains of this class were
known exclusively from the Tertiary period; almost the only source of our
information was to be found in the researches of Ehrenberg, commenced in
1838, continued in his Mikrogeologie in 1854, and concluded in his last
work (L. N. 25) published in 1875 (compare L. N. 16, pp. 3-9, 191-193). In
the year 1876 a number of Mesozoic Radiolaria from the chalk were described
by Zittel (L. N. 28), and afterwards others from the Jura by Dunikowski (L.
N. 44). That fossil Radiolaria occur in Mesozoic formations, especially in
the Jura, as well preserved and as abundantly as in the Tertiary rocks of
Barbados, was shown in 1883 by Rüst (L. N. 48). By the examination of
numerous thin sections he discovered that in all the main divisions of the
Jurassic formation (Lias, Dogger, Malm) there are distributed jaspers,
flints, cherts, and other quartzites, which consist largely of the
siliceous shells of Polycystina; the same is true also of many Coprolites
found in the Jura. The full account of these and the descriptions and
figures of 234 Jurassic species, distributed in 76 genera, are contained in
the Beiträge zur Kenntniss der fossilen Radiolarien aus Gesteinen des Jura
(L. N. 51, 1885). But even in the older rocks, the Trias, the Permian, and
Carboniferous systems, and even as far downwards as the Silurian and
Cambrian formations, Rüst has recently shown the existence of fossil
Radiolaria, {clxxxiii}and thus increased the known period of the
developmental history of the class by many millions of years (§ 244).

The great significance of the Radiolaria in geology and palæontology has
been brought into new light not only by these extensive discoveries, but
also by the important relations which have been shown to exist between the
Radiolarian rocks and the deep-sea deposits of the present day. In this
direction the wonderful discoveries of the Challenger, and especially the
investigation of the deep-sea deposits by Wyville Thomson (L. N. 31) and
John Murray (L. N. 27), have furnished us with new and valuable information
(compare §§ 236-239, and §§ 245-250). The Tertiary Polycystine formations
of Barbados and the Nicobar Islands, with which we have been acquainted for
the last forty years, as also the Mesozoic Radiolarian quartzes, which have
only recently been made known to us from the Jura, are ascertained to be
fossil representatives of the same deep-sea deposits which now occur in the
form of Radiolarian ooze (§ 237), and to some extent also of Globigerina
ooze and red clay (§§ 238, 239), on the bottom of the ocean, at depths of
from 2000 to 4500 fathoms.

These investigations into fossil Radiolaria and their comparison with
recent deep-sea forms have a further general significance, inasmuch as the
identity of many living and fossil species from the Tertiary formation has
been shown beyond all doubt. In this direction the numerous measurements
and accurate comparisons which I have made during the last ten years of the
abyssal forms in the Challenger collection, and of fossil species from
Barbados and Caltanisetta, have brought to light many important facts. In
this I had the able assistance of my friend, Dr. Reinhold Teuscher (compare
§ 250, and p. 1760). Further valuable contributions in this direction are
found in the careful observations and comparative measurements recently
published by Emil Stöhr (L. N. 35, 1880), regarding the Radiolarian fauna
of the Tripoli of Grotte in the province of Girgenti, Sicily. From these it
appears that the number of Miocene species which are still extant, is much
greater than would appear from the results of Ehrenberg.

Ehrenberg himself, towards the end of his long and laborious life,
collected the results of the systematic and palæontological researches,
which he had begun thirty-seven years previously (L. N. 16, pp. 3-12) into
the Polycystina, in two large works (L. N. 24, 25). The first treatise (L.
N. 24, 1872) contains the Mikrogeologische Studien über das Kleinste Leben
der Meeres-Tiefgründe aller Zonen und dessen geologischen Einfluss, with a
list of 279 Polycystina observed by him from the deep-sea, as well as
figures of 127 species. The second work (L. N. 25, 1875) contains the
Fortsetzung der Mikrogeologischen Studien, mit specieller Rücksicht auf den
Polycystinen-Mergel von Barbados; the list of fossil Polycystina observed
by him includes 325 species, of which 26 are still extant; 282 of them are
figured on the thirty plates accompanying the memoir. By means of these
numerous figures, as well as by the appended systematic and chorological
tables, Ehrenberg furnished a welcome {clxxxiv}supplement to the numerous
communications regarding the Polycystina, which he had made to the Berlin
Academy since 1838, and which he had published in his Mikrogeologie in
1854. It will always be the merit of this zealous and indefatigable
microscopist that he first called attention to the great wealth of forms
existing in this class; he separated systematically about 500 species, and
published drawings of about 400; in addition to which he was the first to
lay stress upon the great chorological and geological importance of the
Radiolaria.

With these systematic and descriptive, chorological and palæontological
works, however, which relate exclusively to the Polycystina, the merits of
the famous naturalist of Berlin are exhausted as regards this class of
animals. Of the organisation of the Radiolaria, Gottfried Ehrenberg
remained entirely ignorant up till his death in 1876. All that a number of
famous naturalists had observed during a quarter of a century as to the
structure and life-history of the Radiolaria, all the important discoveries
of Huxley (1851), Johannes Müller (1858), Claparède (1858), Cienkowski
(1871), and many others (L. N. 1-22), and all that I had published in my
Monograph (1862) on the basis of three years' study of their anatomy and
physiology--all this Ehrenberg ignored, or rather, he regarded it all as
worthless rubbish of science, as a chaos of devious errors, resting upon
incomplete observations and false conclusions. His strange "special
considerations regarding the Polycystina" (L. N. 24, pp. 339-346) and the
general "concluding remarks" (L. N. 25, pp. 146-147) leave no room for
doubt on this point. Ehrenberg indeed doubted to the last whether any
observer had seen living Radiolaria at all (L. N. 25, p. 108).

The invincible obstinacy with which Ehrenberg maintained his preconceived
opinion of the high organisation of the Radiolaria, and entirely ignored
the contrary observations of other naturalists, is explained by the
consistency with which he held to the end the "principle peculiar to
himself of the universally equal development of the animal kingdom" (L. N.
16, p. 7). From the complicated arrangement of their siliceous shells he
concluded that the animals inhabiting them must possess a structure
correspondingly complex, and nearly related to that of the Echinodermata
(Holothuria). Like all other animals the Radiolaria must possess systems of
organs for locomotion, sensation, nutrition, circulation, and reproduction.
Whilst Ehrenberg originally interpreted the Polycystina as siliceous
Infusoria polygastrica, and regarded them as compound Arcellina, he
afterwards classed them sometimes with the Echinodermata (Holothuria),
sometimes with the Bryozoa, sometimes with the Oscillaria (see L. N. 41, p.
336). Although a decided opponent of the cell-theory he called them
"multicellular animalcules" (Polycystina), interpreting the pores of the
siliceous shell as cells. To-day the opposite term (Monocystina) might be
adopted to express their unicellular organisation. It was a remarkable
irony of fate that in the self-same year (1838) in which Schwann of Berlin
made by his foundation of the cell theory the greatest advance in the whole
{clxxxv}of Biological Science, that Ehrenberg, all his life the most
zealous opponent of that theory, published his great work on the Infusoria,
and at the same time established the "family of multicellular animalcules
or Polycystina" (L. N. 16, p. 4).

The "short systematic survey of the genera of cellular animalcules" given
by Ehrenberg in 1875 (L. N. 25, p. 157), is only a new edition, increased
by sixteen genera, of his first systematic arrangement of the Polycystina
of 1847 (L. N. 4, p. 53). Since I have already given a full discussion of
this in my Monograph (L. N. 16, pp. 214-219), I need only here remark that
a correct understanding of his very inadequate generic diagnoses is only
possible by the aid of his figures. Relying upon these I have retained
almost all Ehrenberg's genera, although entirely new definitions of most of
them have been necessary.

The same is true also of the two orders which Ehrenberg distinguished in
his class of "Zellenthierchen." The first order is constituted by his
"Netzkörbchen" (Monodictya or NASSELLARIA) formerly known as "Polycystina
solitaria"; they include our #Cyrtoidea#, the greater part of Hertwig's
Monopylea. Ehrenberg's second order is the "Schaumsternchen" (Polydictya or
SPUMELLARIA), previously called "Polycystina composita"; they include the
Peripylea of Hertwig, as well as the Spyridina (our #Spyroidea#), which
belong properly to the NASSELLARIA. Although Ehrenberg's statements
regarding the organisation of both these orders were quite erroneous, and
his knowledge even of the structure of their shells very defective, I still
thought it advisable to retain his names for the groups, since they
constituted his one successful effort in the systematic treatment of the
Radiolaria (compare L. N. 41, p. 336).

The sketch of a systematic arrangement of the Radiolaria (L. N. 37), which
I published in 1881 on the basis of the study of the Challenger Radiolaria,
resembles, in respect of seven orders being distinguished, the new system
which R. Hertwig founded in 1879, in consequence of the variations which he
discovered in the structural relations of the central capsule (L. N. 33, p.
133). It differs, however, inasmuch as his Sphærozoea (my Polycyttaria) are
here divided into two orders, Symbelaria (#Collosphærida#) and Syncollaria
(#Sphærozoida#). In that sketch too I separated for the first time the two
subclasses Holotrypasta (Porulosa) and Merotrypasta (Osculosa). The fifteen
families established by Hertwig were then raised to twenty-four. The six
hundred and thirty genera, which I then distinguished, are still for the
most part retained, some, however, in a restricted sense, or with amended
definitions.

The differential characters of the orders and families of the Radiolaria,
given in the Prodromus in 1881, were amended in a further communication
which I gave in 1883 regarding the orders of the Radiolaria (L. N. 46, p.
17). There I reduced the seven orders to four, the structural relations of
the central capsule being precisely the same in the Polycyttaria and
#Collodaria# as in the #Peripylea#. The survey of the affinities of the
class was thus rendered much simpler and clearer, and the
{clxxxvi}hypothetical genealogical tree, which I then published, has been
still further carried out in Chapter VI. of the present Introduction (see
§§ 153-200).


253. _General Survey of the Growth of our Systematic Acquaintance with the
Radiolaria from 1834 to 1885._

  1834. MEYEN (L. N. 1) describes 2 genera and species of
  #Collodaria#:--_Sphærozoum fuscum_ and _Physematium atlanticum_.

  1838. EHRENBERG (L. N. 2) founds the family Polycystina upon 3 fossil
  genera (with 6 species):--_Lithocampe_, _Cornutella_, _Haliomma_.

  1847. EHRENBERG (L. N. 4) publishes his preliminary communications
  regarding the fossil Polycystina of Barbados and distinguishes 282
  species, distributed in 44 genera and 7 families. In the tabular view of
  the genera he distinguishes two orders:--I. #Solitaria#--(1)
  Halicalyptrina, (2) Lithochytrina, (3) Eucyrtidina; and II.
  #Composita#--(4) Spyridina, (5) Calodictya, (6) Haliommatina, (7)
  Lithocyclidina (compare L. N. 16, pp. 214-219).

  1851. HUXLEY (L. N. 5) gives the first accurate account of living
  Radiolaria, and describes 2 species of the genus _Thalassicolla_
  (_nucleata_ and _punctata_); under the latter are included 4 genera of
  #Sphærozoea#:--_Collozoum_, _Sphærozoum_, _Collosphæra_, _Siphonosphæra_
  (compare L. N. 16, pp. 12-14).

  1854. EHRENBERG (L. N. 6) publishes in his Mikrogeologie, figures of
  seventy-two species of fossil Polycystina (without descriptions).

  1855. JOHANNES MÜLLER (L. N. 8, p. 248) describes the first
  _Acanthometra_, and elucidates its affinity to Huxley's _Thalassicolla_
  and Ehrenberg's Polycystina.

  1858. JOHANNES MÜLLER (L. N. 12) establishes the new group Radiolaria as
  a special order of the Rhizopoda, and includes in it the Thalassicolla,
  Polycystina, and Acanthometra as closely related families. He opposes
  these radiate Rhizopoda to the Polythalamia, and describes 50 species
  observed by him living in the Mediterranean, these he arranges in 20
  genera, of which 10 are new. The figures are contained in eleven plates
  (see L. N. 16, pp. 22-24).

  1858. CLAPARÈDE (L. N. 14) describes the first #Plectoidean#
  (_Plagiacantha arachnoides_) and two species of _Acanthometra_, which he
  had observed living in Norway (see L. N. 16, p. 18).

  1860. EHRENBERG (L. N. 4) gives a short diagnosis of 22 new genera of
  Polycystina, based on the investigation of numerous deep-sea species
  brought up by Brooke from the depths of the Pacific Ocean. The number of
  his genera is thus increased to 66 (compare L. N. 16, pp. 10, 11).

  1862. ERNST HAECKEL (L. N. 16) embraces in his Monograph of the
  Radiolaria all the species hitherto known either by figures or
  descriptions, and arranges them in 15 families and 113 genera; of which
  latter 46 are new. The number of new species observed living amounts to
  144. In a "survey of the Radiolarian fauna of Messina" (p. 565) he
  records 72 genera and 169 species. Most of these are figured in the
  accompanying atlas of thirty-five plates.

  {clxxxvii}1862. BURY (L. N. 17) gives in an atlas of twenty-five plates,
  photographed from drawings, the figures of numerous fossil Polycystina of
  Barbados (without descriptions), of which many are new species overlooked
  by Ehrenberg (compare § 242, above).

  1872. EHRENBERG (L. N. 24) gives a list of names (without description) of
  all the Polycystina observed by him from the bottom of the sea, 279
  species, of which 127 are figured on twelve plates.

  1875. EHRENBERG (L. N. 25) gives a list of names of all the fossil
  Polycystina observed by him (from Barbados, the Nicobar Islands and
  Sicily), 326 species, of which 282 are figured (compare § 242 above). In
  a new "Systematic Survey of the Genera" the number of these is given as
  63. The 7 families are the same as given in 1847 (see above), as also the
  two orders (NASSELLARIA = Solitaria, SPUMELLARIA = Composita).

  1876. ZITTEL (L. N. 29) describes the first fossil Radiolaria from the
  chalk (6 species) and establishes the new Cyrtoid genus _Dictyomitra_.

  1876. JOHN MURRAY (L. N. 27) establishes the new family Challengerida,
  and figures 6 new generic types of PHÆODARIA.

  1879. RICHARD HERTWIG (L. N. 33) first describes the fundamental
  differences in the structure of the central capsule, and in accordance
  with them divides the Radiolaria into six orders:--(1) Thalassicollea,
  (2) Sphærozoea, (3) Peripylea, (4) Acanthometrea, (5) Monopylea, (6)
  Tripylea (p. 133). These are subdivided into 18 families, and their
  phylogenetic affinities discussed (p. 137). On the ten plates, several

  {clxxxviii}1883. ERNST HAECKEL (L. N. 46) revises the 4 orders and 32
  families of Radiolaria, and gives more accurate definitions of them, as
  well as of the 2 subclasses (I. _Holotrypasta_ = ACANTHARIA and
  SPUMELLARIA; II. _Merotrypasta_ = NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA).

  1885. D. RÜST (L. N. 51) describes 234 new species of fossil Radiolaria
  from the Jura, and illustrates them by twenty plates. Among them are 103
  SPUMELLARIA, 130 NASSELLARIA, and 1 PHÆODARIA; these are contained in 35
  genera, of which 20 belong to the Porulosa, and 15 to the Osculosa.

_Definition of the Class:_--#Rhizopoda with unicellular body, divided by a
porous membrane into an internal or intracapsular part (with nucleus), and
an external or extracapsular part (with calymma); propagating by
flagellated spores.#


The RADIOLARIA or CAPSULATE RHIZOPODA, first constituted by Johannes Müller
in the year 1858 as a separate group of the Rhizopoda, form a peculiar
class of the PROTISTA, or unicellular organisms. This class is exclusively
marine, and has in general the characteristic organisation of the
Rhizopoda, with the development of numerous _pseudopodia_ from the surface
of the cell; but it differs from all other Rhizopoda in the possession of a
peculiar _membrane_, dividing the cell-body into two different parts; the
_central capsule_ or the internal part with the _nucleus_, and the external
part or _extracapsulum_ with the _calymma_; propagation by flagellated
spores produced in the central capsule; the sarcode or the _protoplasm_ of
both parts communicates by fine _pores_, piercing the separating membrane,
which is called the _capsule-membrane_.

The _Central Capsule_ or the inner part of the Radiolarian body is
constantly composed of three essential parts, viz.:--

  1. _The Central Nucleus_ (a true cell-nucleus).

  2. _The Intracapsular Sarcode_ (endosarc) or surrounding internal
  protoplasm.

  3. _The Capsule Membrane_ or enveloping porous membrane.

{2}Besides these constant and essential elements, the central capsule
contains very commonly (but not constantly) some other enclosed structures,
viz.:--

  4. An internal or intracapsular skeleton.

  5. Intracapsular vacuoles or alveoli.

  6. Fat-granules or oil-globules.

  7. Crystals of different composition.

  8. Pigment-granules.

_The Extracapsulum_, or the outer part of the Radiolarian body is also
constantly composed of three essential elements,--

  1. _The Calymma_, or the thick extracapsular _jelly-veil_, completely
  enveloping the whole central capsule.

  2. _The Matrix_, or the maternal tissue of the external protoplasm,
  enveloping immediately the capsule-membrane as a thin continuous layer of
  _extracapsular sarcode_ (ectosarc).

  3. _The Pseudopodia_, or the very numerous thread-like filaments of
  protoplasm, which radiate from the matrix; whilst their inner part is
  enclosed in the calymma, their outer part floats freely in the sea-water.

Besides these three constant and essential elements, the extracapsulum
contains very commonly (but not constantly) some other enclosed structures,
viz.:--

  4. An external or extracapsular skeleton.

  5. Extracapsular vacuoles or alveoli.

  6. Fat-granules or oil-globules.

  7. Pigment-granules or a peculiar large body of dark extracapsular
  pigment, the "phæodium."

  8. "Xanthellæ" or "zooxanthellæ," peculiar yellow cells, which contain
  starch and are unicellular yellow Algæ, living as "Symbiontes" in true
  Symbiosis with a great many Radiolaria.

_The Nucleus_ of the Radiolaria is a large true simple cell-nucleus,
originally a solid spherical, roundish or longish body of nuclein. It is
placed either in the centre of the capsule (in most Peripylea) or
excentrically (in most other Radiolaria). Originally solid, the nucleus is
commonly differentiated later into an outer dense nuclear-membrane and an
inner softer or fluid content; either with one single nucleolus or with a
variable number of nucleoli. Originally always simple, the nucleus becomes
afterwards constantly divided into numerous small nuclei, each of which,
together with a part of the surrounding {3}protoplasm, forms a
vibratile-spore or "flagellate-spore." This division in the Acantharia and
in the social (or colonial) Peripylea begins very early, in all other
Radiolaria much later, immediately before propagation.

_The Endoplasm_ or "endosarc," or "intracapsular protoplasm" or "inner
sarcode," in all Radiolaria originally fills that space within the capsule,
which is not taken up by the nucleus. It seems to be employed mainly for
the purpose of propagation, becoming divided earlier or later into numerous
small particles, each of which surrounds a small particle of the nucleus
and forms together with it a flagellate-spore. Besides this the endoplasm
of the Radiolaria seems to have a great significance for the nutrition,
mainly for the interchange of materials. It becomes very often vacuolate or
alveolate, filled with smaller or larger spherical drops of fluid; it
produces very commonly smaller fat-granules or larger oil-globules, and
further pigment-granules of different colours, more rarely crystals and
other peculiar enclosed parts.

_The Membrane_ or "capsule-membrane" is the most typical and characteristic
part of the body of a Radiolarian, sufficient of itself to separate this
class from all other Rhizopoda. At the same time, by its different shape it
presents the best means for the systematic distinction of the four
subclasses or "legions" of the class. The membrane is composed of a special
organic matter (probably nearly related to chitin) and combines density
with elasticity to a high degree. Observed with a high power of the
microscope its margin (or section) appears commonly simple-edged, but often
in larger forms distinctly double-edged.

The legion PHÆODARIA is distinguished by a double membrane (the thinner
inner and thicker outer membranes being separated by an interval); in the
three other legions it is simple. The membrane completely separates the
intracapsular from the extracapsular body, both communicating only by
certain pores or openings in the membrane. With reference to this important
communication, the whole class can be divided into two subclasses,
Holotrypasta and Merotrypasta: the HOLOTRYPASTA contain the Peripylea and
Actipylea, in which the membrane is pierced by innumerable very small
pores; the MEROTRYPASTA consist of the Monopylea and the Cannopylea, in
which the membrane exhibits only one large main opening, distinguished in
the former by a peculiar "porous area," in the latter by an "osculum" or a
prolonged tubule.

_The Calymma_ or "jelly-veil" is the most characteristic part of the
extracapsular body in all Radiolaria; in the majority of the class it is
the most voluminous part of the whole body, being much more voluminous than
all the other parts taken together. The calymma is a structureless, clear,
and transparent jelly-envelope which always includes the whole central
capsule and often also the whole extracapsular skeleton. Owing to the high
degree of its consistence, this jelly-veil takes a very important part in
the formation of the extracapsular skeleton, furnishing the matrix for the
deposition of its tangential parts.

{4}_The Matrix_ or the "maternal tissue of the pseudopodia" is formed in
all Radiolaria by the thin layer of exoplasm or of extracapsular sarcode,
which immediately envelops the central capsule and is itself enclosed by
the calymma. This continuous sarcode-cover of the capsule communicates by
its pores or openings with the endoplasm or the intracapsular sarcode;
whilst from its outer surface arise the pseudopodia. The morphological
signification of the matrix is very small, but the physiological importance
is very great, for it seems to be the chief organ of many vital functions.

_The Pseudopodia_ or the very fine, long, thread-like filaments of exoplasm
arise in all Radiolaria in very great numbers from the surface of the
matrix, and exhibit in general the same characteristic shape as in the
other Rhizopoda. Their inner or proximal part is enclosed within the
jelly-veil or calymma, whilst their outer or distal part floats freely in
the sea-water. Their special motions and modifications exhibit considerable
variations in different groups, their tendency to ramify, anastomose, and
form networks being in some cases very small, in others very great. Also
the characteristic motion of granules in the pseudopodia is very different.
In general those most important exoplasmatic filaments serve as organs both
for the vegetative functions of nutrition, and for the animal functions of
motion and sensation.

_The class_ Radiolaria can be divided according to its varying structure
into four different legions or subclasses, the characters of which are the
following:--


I. PERIPYLEA OR SPUMELLARIA.

  Membrane of the central capsule simple, perforated by innumerable very
  fine pores. Fundamental form originally homaxon or spherical. Skeleton
  wanting or siliceous. No phæodium in the extracapsular calymma. The
  Peripylea comprise two orders:--

  A.  COLLODARIA (without lattice-shell).
  B.  SPHÆRELLARIA (with lattice-shell).

II.  ACTIPYLEA OR ACANTHARIA.

  Membrane of the central capsule simple, perforated by innumerable fine
  pores. Fundamental form originally homaxon or spherical. Skeleton
  acanthinic (not siliceous). No phæodium in the extracapsular calymma. The
  Actipylea consist of two orders:--

  A.  ACANTHOMETRA (without complete lattice-shell).
  B.  ACANTHOPHRACTA (with complete lattice-shell).


{5}III. MONOPYLEA OR NASSELLARIA.

  Membrane of the central capsule simple, perforated by a porous-area, or
  by one single large opening, divided into numerous very fine pores.
  Fundamental form originally monaxon or egg-shaped. Skeleton siliceous. No
  phæodium in the extracapsular calymma. The Monopylea comprise two
  orders:--

  A.  PLECTELLARIA (without complete lattice-shell).
  B.  CYRTELLARIA (with complete lattice-shell).

IV. CANNOPYLEA OR PHÆODARIA.

  Membrane of the central capsule double, perforated by one simple
  main-opening, prolonged into a tubulus, and besides this commonly by one
  or two (rarely more) small accessory openings. Fundamental form
  originally monaxon or egg-shaped. Skeleton siliceous. Constantly a
  peculiar dark pigment-body or "phæodium" in the extracapsular calymma.
  The Cannopylea comprise two orders:--

  A.  PHÆOCYSTINA (without lattice-shell).
  B.  PHÆOCOSCINA (with lattice-shell).

{6}LEGION I. #SPUMELLARIA#,

VEL PERIPYLEA, VEL PERIPYLARIA (PLS. 1-50).

  _Spumellaria_ (_exclusis_ Spyridinis), Ehrenberg, 1875.
  _Peripylea_ (_inclusis_ Thalassicollis et Sphærozois), Hertwig, 1879.
  _Peripylaria_ (_inclusis_ Collodariis et Polycyttariis), Haeckel, 1881.

_Definition._--Radiolaria with simple membrane of the central capsule,
which is everywhere perforated by innumerable very fine pores.
Extracapsulum without phæodium. Skeleton wanting or siliceous. Fundamental
form originally spherical.

The legion SPUMELLARIA vel PERIPYLEA, in the extent here defined, was
constituted by me in 1883 in my paper on Die Ordnungen der Radiolarien.[2]
I propose to retain for this legion either the name SPUMELLARIA of
Ehrenberg (1875) or PERIPYLEA of Hertwig (1879), although both groups have
not quite the same extension. We exclude from the SPUMELLARIA the Spyridina
(united with them by Ehrenberg) and include the Collodaria. With the
Peripylea of Hertwig we unite his Thalassicollea and Sphærozoea. To avoid
any confusion it would perhaps be better to name this legion "Peripylaria."

The SPUMELLARIA agree with the ACANTHARIA in the structure of the simple
capsule-membrane, which is perforated by numerous small pores (but devoid
of the large main opening, which the NASSELLARIA and PHÆODARIA possess),
whence we unite both the former as Holotrypasta, both the latter as
Merotrypasta.

The difference between the two legions of Holotrypasta is determined by the
skeleton, which in the SPUMELLARIA is either siliceous or wanting, whilst
in the Acantharia it consists of the peculiar organic substance, acanthin.

The legion SPUMELLARIA is by far the largest and most important of the four
legions of Radiolaria, as well with respect to the number of different
forms, as to the enormous masses of individuals, which we encounter living
and fossil. We distinguish in this legion not less than thirty-two
different families, three hundred and sixteen genera, and more than
seventeen hundred species.

The classification of this large group requires for its better
comprehension a careful division into larger and smaller groups. We divide
it therefore first of all into two orders, #Collodaria# and #Sphærellaria#,
as proposed in the paper mentioned above.[3]

The #Collodaria# have no perfect latticed skeleton, and comprise two
suborders or sections: in the #Colloidea# the skeleton is entirely wanting,
in the #Beloidea# it is represented by a variable number of siliceous
needles or spicules, scattered in the calymma around the central capsule.

{7}The #Sphærellaria# differ from the #Collodaria# in the possession of a
perfect siliceous skeleton, which is originally a latticed spherical shell,
enveloping the central capsule. By modification of this fenestrated sphere
arises an enormous mass of different forms, which we dispose in
twenty-eight families, and these in four larger groups, suborders or
sections,--#Sphæroidea#, #Prunoidea#, #Discoidea#, and #Larcoidea#.

The #Sphæroidea#, the common ancestral group of the #Sphærellaria#, possess
a skeleton which is either a simple fenestrated sphere, or composed of two
or more concentric latticed spheres, which are united by radial beams; more
rarely it becomes more or less spongy.

The #Prunoidea# are derived from the #Sphæroidea# by prolongation of the
latticed sphere in one axis; the skeleton therefore becomes here
ellipsoidal or cylindrical (often with annular transversal constrictions).

The #Discoidea# on the contrary must be derived from the #Sphæroidea# by
shortening in one axis; here therefore the fenestrated shell becomes more
or less lenticular or iscoidal (often with radial spines or arms in the
equatorial plane, on the circular margin).

The #Larcoidea#, the fourth section, differ from the three foregoing
sections by the different growth of the shell in three different dimensions
of space; therefore here the fenestrated shell becomes "lentelliptical," or
a "triaxial ellipsoid," its length, breadth, and height being different.




_The Skeleton_ consists in all SPUMELLARIA either of pure _silica_ or of a
peculiar silicate. The siliceous bars and beams constituting it are
invariably _solid_, as also in the NASSELLARIA, never hollow, as in the
PHÆODARIA. Never is the skeleton composed of acanthin, as in all
ACANTHARIA. Whilst in the first order of SPUMELLARIA, #Collodaria#, the
form of the spicula, or the scattered needles, composing the skeleton, is
very simple, _never latticed_, in the second order, the #Sphærellaria#, it
is constantly latticed or fenestrated, often also spongy.

The geometrical fundamental form of the lattice-shell in the #Sphærellaria#
is originally spherical (homaxon), as preserved in all #Sphæroidea#; in the
#Prunoidea# and #Discoidea# it becomes monaxon, with one single axis
(prolonged in the former, shortened in the latter); in the #Larcoidea# it
becomes triaxon, by different growth in three principal axes, perpendicular
one to another. The further development of radial parts of the skeleton in
these three axes is very important for the "promorphology" of the
Radiolaria.

_The Malacoma_, or the whole soft body of the SPUMELLARIA as opposed to the
skeleton, exhibits some differences of structure in two different groups,
which were separated formerly (1862) as Monocyttaria and Polycyttaria,
corresponding to the "Radiolaria monozoa and polyzoa" of Johannes Müller
(1858).

The #Monocyttaria# (or the Spumellaria solitaria) live isolated as single
cells--like {8}all other Radiolaria--and are never aggregated in colonies;
the calymma includes one single central capsule, and this again one central
nucleus, which does not become divided until full maturity.

The #Polycyttaria# on the contrary (or the Spumellaria socialia) live
aggregated in large colonies; the calymma includes a variable number of
associated central capsules and each of these commonly one central
oil-globule, whilst the original simple nucleus commonly becomes very early
divided into numerous small nuclei.

_The Nucleus_ of the SPUMELLARIA is originally constantly _central_, placed
quite in the centre of the concentric capsule, and it retains this central
position in all Monocyttaria or solitary Peripylea; whereas in the
Polycyttaria--in consequence of its early division--its place is commonly
taken by a central oil-globule. Whilst the numerous nuclei of the latter
are very small, the single nucleus of the former is comparatively large,
extremely large (more than a millimeter in diameter) in some gigantic
#Collodaria#.

_The Endoplasm_ or the intracapsular sarcode exhibits in the greater number
of SPUMELLARIA a more or less distinct radial striation. It encloses a
great variety of different parts; vacuoles, oil-globules, pigment-granules,
crystals, &c.

_The Membrane_ of the capsule in all SPUMELLARIA is simple (never double as
in the _Phæodaria_) and everywhere equally perforated by innumerable small
pores; in the thick, double-edged membrane of many large #Collodaria# these
pores appear (in the optical section of the capsule-wall) as distinct fine
radial canals, very densely and regularly disposed.

_The Central Capsule_ in the SPUMELLARIA is originally a _geometrical
sphere_, and this simple globular form is preserved in all #Sphæroidea#,
and in the greatest part of #Colloidea# and #Beloidea#. By prolongation of
one axis the form becomes _ellipsoidal_ (or even cylindrical) in the
#Prunoidea#, and in some few forms of #Colloidea#. By shortening of one
axis it becomes _lenticular_ (or even discoidal) in the _Discoidea_, and in
some few forms of #Colloidea#. By unequal growth in three different axes,
perpendicular one to another, the capsule becomes _lentelliptical_ in all
#Larcoidea#. Very rarely the capsule assumes in the SPUMELLARIA a
polyhedral or irregular (sometimes even amoeboid) form, only in a few
#Colloidea#.

_The Calymma_, or the jelly-veil including the central capsule, is very
voluminous in many SPUMELLARIA of gigantic size, mainly in the large
#Colloidea#, and in all Polycyttaria or social Radiolaria. It includes here
a considerable number of large vacuoles or "alveoli." The calymma never
exhibits in this legion the dark voluminous phæodium, possessed by all
PHÆODARIA.

_Xanthellæ_ or "zooxanthellæ" are numerous in the calymma of most
SPUMELLARIA, but by no means constant; they are very variable in number and
size.

_The Matrix_, placed between the calymma and central capsule, is, in the
majority of the SPUMELLARIA, a rather thick layer of granular exoplasm.

_The Pseudopodia_ arising from it are very numerous, equally disposed over
the whole {9}surface, and are in general rather fluid, exhibiting a
considerable tendency to ramify, anastomose, and form networks. The
movement of granules is commonly lively. In the Polycyttaria all capsules
of one colony or "coenobium" are connected by the dense variable network of
anastomosing pseudopodia.

_Definition._--SPUMELLARIA without latticed shell.

The order #Collodaria#, the first order of Radiolaria, comprises all those
SPUMELLARIA in which the skeleton is either entirely wanting, or
represented by numerous single, solid, siliceous needles or spicules,
loosely scattered in the calymma around the central capsule. Never in this
order is there any trace of the latticed or fenestrated shell, which
characterises the second order, #Sphærellaria#. The skeleton exhibits no
trace of phylogenetic connection in the two orders.

In my monograph (1862) two families appertaining to this order are
described, the Collida (p. 244) and the Sphærozoida (p. 521). Both families
contain forms with and without a skeleton. Of the solitary or monozous
Collida the Thalassicollida are devoid of a skeleton, whilst the
Thalassosphærida are provided with a skeleton. Of the social or polyzous
Sphærozoida the Collozoida are without a skeleton, the Rhaphidozoida
provided with one. As the special form in both skeletophorous subfamilies
is exactly the same, I prefer now to associate them in the suborder
#Beloidea#, and to oppose them to the other two skeletonless subfamilies,
which are united under the name of #Colloidea#.

Suborder I. COLLOIDEA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--SPUMELLARIA without skeleton.

The suborder #Colloidea# comprises all those SPUMELLARIA in which no
skeleton is developed. The whole body is therefore soft--a true
malacoma--and is composed only of two essential parts, the central capsule
and the enveloping extracapsulum. The suborder contains only two different
families, the solitary #Thalassicollida# (or Colloidea monozoa) and the
associated #Collozoida# (or Colloidea polyzoa). Both families are very
nearly allied, and differ only in one single essential character: the
solitary life of the former, the social union of the latter. It seems to be
merely in consequence of this difference that the cleavage of the nucleus
commonly takes place very late in the former, very early in the latter.

Therefore the full-grown Thalassicollida (till immediately before
propagation) commonly exhibit one single nucleus in the centre of the
capsule, whilst in the Collozoida the capsule is distended by numerous
small nuclei. In these latter the centre of the capsule usually contains
one large oil-globule, whilst in the former oil-globules are either
wanting, or scattered in large numbers in the endoplasm, or disposed in one
layer on the inside of the capsule membrane.

In the solitary Thalassicollida each capsule is enclosed in its own
peculiar spherical calymma, whilst in the associated Collozoida all
capsules of the colony are united in one common, very voluminous calymma.

  _Thalassicollida_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 246.
  _Thalassicollida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 469.

_Definition._--#Colloidea# solitaria.

The family Thalassicollida comprises all solitary SPUMELLARIA without a
skeleton. The oldest and best known form of this family is the genus
_Thalassicolla_, as restricted by {11}Johannes Müller.[4] The most common
representative of it, the cosmopolitan _Thalassicolla nucleata_, was first
described by Huxley in 1851. But as early as 1834 another large
Radiolarian, appertaining either to this or to a nearly allied family, had
been described by Meyen as _Physematium atlanticum_. A third genus was
detected by me in 1859 at Messina and figured under the name _Thalassolampe
margarodes_.[5] A very accurate histological description of these forms was
given in 1876 by Richard Hertwig.[6] The same author figured in his
Organismus in 1879 a very interesting simpler form under the name
_Thalassolampe primordialis_ (Taf. iii. fig. 5). Some similar forms had
already been observed by me, and are here united with it to form the first
genus _Actissa_.[7]

_Actissa_ is of the highest general interest as the most simple and typical
form of all Radiolaria, and as the common ancestral form, from which all
other forms of this large class may be derived. Its unicellular body
exhibits neither the extracapsular alveoli of _Thalassicolla_, nor the
intracapsular alveoli of _Thalassolampe_, and shows all essential
characters of the Radiolarian type in its most simple form (Pl. 1, figs. 1
to 1_c_). The simple cell-body is composed of a spherical central capsule
and a concentric, spherical, enveloping calymma, both separated by a thin
membrane which is perforated by innumerable pores. The capsule includes the
endoplasm and in the centre a simple spherical nucleus with nucleolus; at
the time of propagation this latter becomes cleft into numerous small
nuclei, each of which, together with a small piece of the surrounding
endoplasm, forms a flagellated zoospore (fig. 1_c_). The extracapsulum is
formed by the large, structureless, spherical calymma or concentric
jelly-veil enveloping the capsule, and by the thin granular matrix or the
layer of exoplasm which separates the calymma from the membrane. From this
matrix or maternal tissue arise innumerable very long and thin pseudopodia,
as simple radiating filaments, the proximal part of which is included in
the calymma, whilst the distal part floats freely in the sea-water (Pl. 1,
fig. 1).

The other Thalassicollida differ from their common ancestral form,
_Actissa_, mainly by the higher histological differentiation of the
unicellular body. Whilst in _Thalassicolla_ and _Thalassolampe_ the nucleus
remains a single sphere as in _Actissa_, it becomes branched or covered
with radial blind saccules in _Thalassopila_ and _Thalassophysa_; also the
intracapsular protoplasm develops here a great variety of peculiar
different corpuscles, as oil-globules, pigment-granules, concentric
concretions, crystals, &c. But the most striking peculiarity by which the
other Thalassicollida differ from _Actissa_ is the development of large
vesicular alveoli, either within or without the capsule; the unicellular
body reaches by this inflation the extraordinary size of 5 to 10 mm. or
more.

Genus 1. _Actissa_,[8] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Thalassicollida# with simple spherical nucleus, without any
alveoli (either within or outside the central capsule).

The genus _Actissa_ is the most simple and typical form of all Radiolaria,
and may be regarded as the common ancestral form of the whole class. The
spherical body is composed of a simple spherical capsule and a concentric
spherical calymma or jelly-envelope. Neither the former nor the latter
contains alveoli. The central capsule possesses a strong membrane
perforated by small pores, and contains in the intracapsular sarcode
numerous small pellucid vacuoles, and in its middle a simple, concentric,
spherical nucleus (often with some nucleoli); sometimes also one or more
oil-globules. The extracapsularium forms a soft, voluminous, structureless
calymma or enveloping jelly-sphere, perforated by the numberless, fine
pseudopodia, which radiate outwards from the matrix or the thin granulated
sarcode-layer, surrounding the capsule. Often (but not constantly)
xanthellæ or yellow cells are scattered in it. _Actissa_ differs from the
following skeletonless genera in the absence of all alveoli; it has neither
intracapsular alveoli (like _Thalassolampe_) nor extracapsular alveoli
(like _Thalassicolla_). The first observed species of this genus is that
which I found in 1866 at the Canary Islands, _Actissa prototypus_; the
second is that which Hertwig accurately described in 1879, from the
Mediterranean (Messina), _Actissa primordialis_; the third I observed in
1881 at Ceylon, frequent and sporiparous, _Actissa princeps_. A fourth
species (_Actissa radiata_) exhibited a distinct radial segmentation of the
capsule-contents. These four species are quite spherical. Six other
species, occurring in different preparations from the Challenger, are
distinguished by modifications of the spherical capsule-form and may
represent three different subgenera (or, perhaps better,

Genus 2. _Thalassolampe_,[9] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 253.

_Definition._--#Thalassicollida# without extracapsular alveoles, but with
large roundish or globular alveoles within the central capsule, with a
simple spherical, not branched nucleus in the centre.

The genus _Thalassolampe_ is, next to _Actissa_, the most simple of all
Radiolaria, but differs from it by the large intracapsular alveoles. By
these the central capsule is inflated to an extraordinary size, which in
_Thalassolampe maxima_ exceeds that of most other Radiolaria. From the
nearly allied _Thalassopila_ it differs by the simple spherical nucleus,
from _Physematium_ by the absence of spicula. Of the two species of the
genus the first observed _Thalassolampe margarodes_, 1862, is
Mediterranean, the second, _Thalassolampe maxima_, 1882, is Indian.

Spherical body very soft and limpid, somewhat pearl-like opalescent,
yellowish or bluish. Central capsule with a very thin structureless
membrane, its diameter six to eight times as large as that of the central
spherical nucleus. Wall of the vesicular nucleus thick, perforated by fine
{17}pore-canals; on its inside often numerous oval nucleoli. In the movable
protoplasmic network between the large alveoles a considerable number of
large yellowish or orange oil-globules. Extracapsular jelly-envelope very
thin, contains small yellow bodies (zooxanthellæ). (Compare the accurate
description of this Mediterranean species in my monograph and in Hertwig's
work.) In the Canary Islands I found very often a large variety of it, of
double and triple the size, distinguished by the delicate orange colour of
the intracapsular oil-globules. This may be distinguished as _Thalassolampe
aurantiaca_.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the whole jelly-sphere 2 to 4 mm., of the
central capsule 2 to 3 mm., of its nucleus 0.2 to 0.4 mm.

Lanzerote, Haeckel; surface.


2. _Thalassolampe maxima_, n. sp. (Pl. 1, fig. 2).

Spherical body quite pellucid, like a glass globule, colourless. Central
capsule with a moderately thick, but quite transparent, structureless
membrane, its diameter ten to twelve times as large as that of the central
spherical nucleus. Wall of the vesicular nucleus thick, perforated by fine
pore-canals; on its inside numerous small spherical nucleoli. No large
oil-globules in the movable protoplasmic network between the large
alveoles. Extracapsular jelly-envelope very thin, containing no yellow
bodies. This differs from the preceding nearly allied species in the want
of the intracapsular oil-globules and of the extracapsular yellow bodies.
It possesses the largest central capsule of all known Radiolaria. I found
them living and floating in water taken from the surface of the Indian
Ocean by a bucket.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the whole jelly-body 12 to 15 mm., of the
central capsule 10 to 12 mm., of the nucleus 0.8 to 1.2 mm.

Genus 3. _Thalassopila_,[10] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 469.

_Definition._--Thalassicollida without extracapsular alveoles, but with
large roundish or globular alveoles within the central capsule, with a
papillate or branched nucleus in its centre.

The genus _Thalassopila_ has, like _Thalassolampe_, a voluminous foamy
central capsule, inflated by numerous large alveoles; but it differs in the
complicated form of the nucleus, which is like that of _Thalassophysa_, and
is either branched or occupied by conical or roundish papillæ.


1. _Thalassopila cladococcus_, n. sp. (Pl. 1, fig. 3).

Spherical body dark-spotted, with a thin yellowish jelly-envelope. Central
capsule with a thick and firm membrane, perforated by pores; its diameter
three times that of the central nucleus, {18}three-fourths that of the
whole jelly-sphere. Nucleus profusely branched or papillated, its spherical
surface covered with numerous (more than a hundred) finger-shaped obtuse
blind sacs, about as long as its radius. Protoplasm of the central capsule
forming a loose network between the large roundish alveoles, in the
cortical zone radially striped and containing one layer of large dark
oil-globules. These are regularly distributed on the inside of the
capsule-membrane and separated by intervals, twice as broad as its
diameter, giving to the capsule-surface a spotted appearance. Extracapsular
jelly-envelope thin, yellowish, with very numerous and small xanthellæ.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the whole jelly-sphere 5 mm., of the central
capsule 4 mm., of the nucleus 1.3 mm.

_Habitat._--Antarctic Ocean, Station 154 (south of Kerguelen), surface.



Genus 4. _Thalassicolla_,[11] Huxley, 1851, Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., ser.
2, vol. viii. p. 433.

_Definition._--Thalassicollida without intracapsular alveoles, but with
large roundish or globular alveoles within the extracapsular calymma.
Nucleus in the centre of the capsule simple spherical, not branched.

The genus _Thalassicolla_ was proposed by Huxley in 1851, for a certain
number of different voluminous jelly-like Radiolaria, which he had observed
living during his voyage in the "Rattlesnake" through the tropical seas,
and of which he gives an excellent description--the first accurate
observations on living Radiolaria. Johannes Müller afterwards removed from
this genus the social genera _Sphærozoum_ and _Collosphæra_ (formerly
_Thalassicolla punctata_), and retained as type of the genus _Thalassicolla
nucleata_. In 1862 in my Monograph I added two other species,
_Thalassicolla pelagica_ and _Thalassicolla zanclea_, and later (1870)
_Thalassicolla sanguinolenta_. Now I think it better to separate the last
two species as a new genus, _Thalassophysa_, characterised by the papillate
or branched nucleus, and to retain in _Thalassicolla_ only those forms with
simple spherical nucleus. For both genera the extracapsular, voluminous,
spherical calymma or jelly-envelope, with numerous large alveoles, is
characteristic. The membrane of the central capsule in _Thalassicolla_ is
now structureless (subgenus _Thalassicollarium_, with three species), now
characterised by a peculiar structure, prominent ridges on the inside of
the membrane, which form a network with polygonal plates, resembling an
epithelium (Pl. 1, fig. 5_b_; subgenus _Thalassicollidium_, with four
species). Of the seven species here described, two are cosmopolitan, widely
distributed, and common; one is Mediterranean, one Atlantic, and three
Pacific.

{22}The genus _Thalassophysa_ contains those species of Thalassicollida
formerly associated with _Thalassicolla_, which are distinguished by the
complicated, ramose, or papillate form of the large nucleus. All three
species here described are found in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. To
this genus appertains also that strange form of Radiolaria which I
described in 1870 as _Myxobrachia_ (compare _Thalassophysa sanguinolenta_).

Family II. #COLLOZOIDA#, Haeckel, 1862 (Pl. 3).

_Collozoida_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 522.

_Definition._--#Colloidea# socialia.

The family Collozoida comprises all associated or colony-building
Radiolaria without skeleton. We unite here all these skeletonless
Radiolarian colonies into one single genus _Collozoum_, constituted (1862)
in my Monograph (p. 522). The oldest known form of it was the _Collozoum
inerme_, described firstly by Johannes Müller (1856) as _Sphærozoum
inerme_. Two other species of the genus were figured (1862) in my Monograph
(p. 522, Tafn. xxxii., xxxv.). A most accurate description of its
histological structure and {24}development was given in 1876 by Richard
Hertwig in his Histologie der Radiolarien (pp. 12-42, Tafn. i., ii.). A
number of other very remarkable forms of _Collozoum_ have been observed by
me during the last few years, and partly figured in Pl. 3.

_Collozoum_, as the only representative of this family, is sufficiently
distinguished from all other Radiolaria by the definition "_Skeletonless
Radiolarian Colonies._" These occur floating on the surface of all warmer
seas, often in astonishing masses, and may be easily confounded, owing to
their external resemblance, with the jelly-like egg-masses of certain
Mollusca. _Collozoum_ is derived either from _Actissa_ or from
_Thalassicolla_, simply by multiplication of the unicellular body and by
reunion of the associated capsules in one common calymma or jelly-veil;
this is constantly alveolated, as in _Thalassicolla_. As in _Actissa_, the
form of the central capsule remains either spherical, or it becomes
ellipsoidal or discoidal, rarely polyhedral or amoeboid. In _Collozoum_ as
in all colonial Radiolaria, the original central nucleus commonly undergoes
cleavage very early into numerous small nuclei, whilst its place is usually
taken by a central oil-globule. This peculiarity may serve often (but not
constantly) for the distinction of isolated capsules of _Collozoum_ from
_Actissa_.



Genus 6. _Collozoum_,[13] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 522.

_Definition._--Skeletonless colonies of Radiolaria.

The genus _Collozoum_, as already mentioned, is the only representative of
its family, and comprises all Radiolaria living associated in colonies, and
having no skeleton. Therefore _Collozoum_ possesses all the peculiarities
described above. Although the floating colonies of this genus occur in
enormous masses on the surface of all warmer seas, nevertheless the number
of different species in this genus is not great, and amounts only to
thirteen. If this number increase by further investigations, the subgenera
distinguished in the following description can be advanced to the range of
genera; in which case _Collodinium_ (or _Collozoum_ sensu restricto) will
be characterised by the spherical form of its central capsules,
_Colloprunum_ by the ellipsoidal form (Pl. 3, fig. 9), _Collophidium_ by
the cylindrical, very prolonged form (figs. 2, 3), _Collodiscus_ by the
lenticular or discoidal form, and _Collodastrum_ by the indefinite,
polyhedral, or amoeboid form (figs. 4, 5).

Suborder II. BELOIDEA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--SPUMELLARIA with an imperfect skeleton, composed of numerous
solid needles or spicula, scattered irregularly in the calymma.


The suborder #Beloidea# comprises all those SPUMELLARIA which possess an
imperfect or rudimentary skeleton, composed of a variable number of
isolated spicula scattered in the extracapsulum. The suborder contains only
two different families, the solitary Thalassosphærida (or Beloidea monozoa)
and the associated Sphærozoida (or Beloidea polyzoa). Both families are
very nearly allied, and differ only in one single character: the solitary
life of the former, the social union of the {29}latter. It seems to be
merely a consequence of this difference that the cleavage of the nucleus
commonly takes place very late in the former, very early in the latter.

Commonly, therefore, the full-grown Thalassosphærida (until immediately
before their propagation) exhibit one single nucleus in the centre of the
capsule, whilst in the Sphærozoida the capsule is distended with numerous
small nuclei. In these latter the centre of the capsule usually contains
one large oil-globule, whilst in the former oil-globules are either wanting
or scattered in large numbers in the endoplasm, or disposed in one layer on
the inside of the capsule membrane.

In the solitary Thalassosphærida each capsule is enclosed in its own
peculiar spherical calymma, whilst in the associated Sphærozoida all the
capsules of the colony are united into one common, very voluminous,
alveolated calymma.



Family III. #THALASSOSPHÆRIDA#, Haeckel, 1862, (Pl. 2).

_Thalassosphærida_, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 255.

_Definition._--#Beloidea# solitaria.

The family Thalassosphærida comprises all solitary SPUMELLARIA with an
imperfect skeleton, composed of numerous solid needles or spicula,
scattered around the central capsule in the calymma. The structure of the
unicellular soft body is quite the same as in the Thalassicollida; it
differs from these only in the possession of the extracapsular skeleton.
All needles of this skeleton are solid siliceous spicula, never hollow, as
in the similar Cannorrhaphida among the PHÆODARIA. In the special structure
and form of the skeleton the Thalassosphærida agree perfectly with the
well-known, colony-building Sphærozoida; they differ from these only by
their hermit-like life and by some peculiarities derived from this solitary
development.

The oldest known form of this family is probably the first Radiolarian,
observed in the living state, described in 1834 by Meyen as _Physematium
atlanticum_ (see p. 35). A second form was figured in my Monograph (1862)
as _Thalassosphæra bifurca_ (p. 260, Taf. xii. fig. 1). A third form was
there described under the name _Thalassosphæra morum_; this remarkable form
was first observed by Johannes Müller, and figured under the name
_Thalassicolla morum_ (1858, Abhandl., p. 28, Taf. vii. figs. 1, 2). The
same form was afterwards observed living by myself in the Mediterranean, as
well as in the Atlantic, and in great numbers by the late Sir Wyville
Thomson in the Pacific. The latter gave a good figure of it with some
valuable remarks in his excellent work, The Atlantic (1877, vol. i. p. 233,
fig. 51). He called this peculiar Rhizopod _Calcaromma calcarea_, on
account of the very peculiar _calcareous_ bodies "looking in outline like
the rowels of spurs," which are accumulated in great quantity around the
central capsule, in the calymma. Further investigations have convinced me
that these peculiar stellate {30}bodies of carbonate of lime, for which we
propose the name "Calcastrella," are not parts of the skeleton produced by
the Radiolarian, but foreign bodies picked up by its extracapsular sarcode
(in the same way as the Coccoliths are picked up by _Thalassicolla
sanguinolenta = Myxobrachia!_). These Calcastrella occur also in the
calymma of some Discoidea and other Radiolaria; they are either unicellular
calcareous Algæ, or foreign bodies of other origin. The _Collodarium_,
however, described as _Thalassicolla morum_ and _Calcaromma calcarea_,
seems to be a simple _Actissa_, which has picked up a number of
Calcastrella.

The Challenger collection has yielded a number of other true
Thalassosphærida, which partly agree with _Thalassosphæra_ in the simple
structure of the unicellular body (resembling _Actissa_), and partly differ
from it in the development of alveoles, either within or without the
central capsule (similar to _Thalassolampe_ and _Thalassicolla_). The solid
siliceous spicula, which occur in great numbers scattered in the calymma,
agree perfectly in form with the spicula of the colony-building
Sphærozoida. A characteristic difference between the social and the
solitary #Beloidea# seems to be determined by the cleavage of the nucleus,
which takes place in the latter very late, in the former very early.
Therefore in the large central capsule of the mature solitary
Thalassosphærida, we commonly find one large nucleus in the centre, and a
number of oil-globules around it in the endosarc, or disposed in one layer
on the inside of the capsule-membrane (Pl. 2, figs. 2, 5); whereas in the
much smaller associated capsules of the Sphærozoida one large oil-globule
is placed commonly in the centre, and a great number of small nuclei
scattered in the endoplasm (compare above, p. 24).

Genus 7. _Thalassosphæra_,[14] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 259.

_Definition._--Thalassosphærida without alveoles, with simple, unbranched,
needle-shaped spicula in the calymma.

The genus _Thalassosphæra_ was founded by me in 1862 for those solitary
#Collodaria# in which the simple central capsule is surrounded by scattered
solid spicula. {31}I described these two different species, the new
_Thalassosphæra bifurca_ and the _Thalassosphæra morum_, which J. Müller
had formerly called _Thalassicolla morum_. This latter form is
characterised by peculiar _calcareous_ bodies "looking in outline like the
rowels of spurs, scattered irregularly in the gelatinous envelope," and was
therefore afterwards called "_Calcaromma calcarea_" by Sir Wyville
Thomson.[15] As already mentioned above, these calcareous rowels are
foreign bodies, picked up by an _Actissa_ (see p. 29). I here confine the
genus _Thalassosphæra_ to those solitary #Beloidea# in which the body
exhibits no alveoles, and the siliceous solid spicula in the calymma are
quite simple needles.

_Definition._--Thalassosphærida without alveoles, with numerous branched or
compound spicula in the calymma.

The genus _Thalassoxanthium_ differs from the foregoing _Thalassosphæra_,
by the ramification of the spicula, and has therefore the same relation to
it as _Sphærozoum_ to _Belonozoum_. The soft unicellular body is as simple
as in _Actissa_, and exhibits alveoles neither in the capsule nor in the
calymma.

_Definition._--Spicula not geminate, but simply radiate, consisting of
three, four, or more needles or shanks, radiating in different directions
from one and the same point; shanks now simple or needle-like, now furcate
or branched.

3. _Thalassoxanthium medusinum_, n. sp. (Pl. 2, fig. 5).

Spicula all (or nearly all) quadriradiate, irregular, composed of four (or
sometimes in a few spicula three) needle-like shanks (mostly of unequal
length), diverging from one common point. Shanks curved, pointed, thorny,
covered with small spinules. Central capsule dusky, twice to three times as
large as its dark central nucleus. On the inside of the membrane numerous
large oil-globules. Jelly-envelope thin, with numerous xanthellæ.

few spicula three) needle-like shanks, diverging in two opposite
hemispheres (three needles upwards, three needles downwards). Shanks
somewhat curved, pointed, smooth. Central capsule yellowish-brown, dark,
four times as broad as its dark central nucleus. Jelly-envelope thick
(about twice as broad as the capsule), with very numerous xanthellæ.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the central capsule 0.3 to 0.4, of its nucleus
0.1 to 0.12.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic, Station 325, surface.


{33}5. _Thalassoxanthium cervicorne_, n. sp. (Pl. 2, figs. 3, 4).

Spicula all triradiate, trichotomously branched, with three equal shanks,
which diverge from one common point, and are again provided each with three
branches on the distal end. These nine branches are commonly once or twice
forked (each fork rarely provided with three ramules). The ramules are
thin, unequal, curved, or bent, and the ramification nearly resembles a
stag's horn. Central capsule transparent, without oil-globules, two to
three times as broad as the dark nucleus, which contains one single long
central nucleolus. Calymma thin, scarcely as thick as the radius of the
nucleus.

Subgenus 2. _Thalassoxanthomma_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Spicula all or partly geminate, consisting of one middle or
axial rod, from the two poles of which diverge two, three, or more shanks
in different directions. Shanks or needle-rays sometimes simple,
needle-like, sometimes bifurcated or branched.


6. _Thalassoxanthium furcatum_, n. sp.

  Wiss. Berlin, p. 845.

Spicula all geminate and double forked, composed of a simple axial rod and
two forked branches on each end; these branches are again forked, so that
each spiculum exhibits eight thin distal ends. All branches are thin,
slender and straight. Central capsule red, four times as broad as the
central nucleus, containing between the red pigment-granules numerous,
peculiar, violin-shaped bodies (fat-corpuscles?). Compare fig. 1, _loc.

{34}8. _Thalassoxanthium ovodimare_, n. sp.

Spicula all geminate, composed of a simple, very short axial rod and three
diverging shanks or branches on each end of it; the shanks are very thin,
straight, or little curved, and eight to ten times as long as the axial
rod. The spicula are quite smooth, as in the similar _Sphærozoum ovodimare_
(in which, however, the axial rod is much longer). Central capsule
transparent, without oil-globules, twice as broad as the nucleus.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the capsule 0.4, of the nucleus 0.2, length of
the spicula 0.1 to 0.2.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 273, surface.

Spicula all geminate-triradiate, composed of a simple middle rod and of
three diverging shanks on each end of it; the shanks are thorny with small
spinules and shorter than the axial rod, very similar to the common

middle rod. Central capsule dark, filled with pigment-granules, without
oil-globules, four times as large as the nucleus.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the capsule 0.5, of the nucleus 0.12, length of
the spicula 0.2 to 0.4.

Genus 9. _Physematium_,[17] Meyen, 1834, Nova Acta Acad. Nat. Curios., vol.
xvi., Suppl., p. 286 (p. 162).

_Definition._--#Thalassosphærida# with large numerous alveoles within the
central capsule (not in the calymma), and with numerous simple,
needle-shaped spicula in the calymma.

The genus _Physematium_ is, together with the colony-forming _Sphærozoum_,
the first Radiolarian which was observed in the living state, described in
1834 by Meyen. It is most nearly allied to _Thalassolampe_, and has the
same large roundish alveoles within the central capsule, which reaches
therefore an extraordinary size, 5 to 10 mm. It {35}differs from the latter
by the possession of spicula in the calymma. The peculiar "centripetale
Zell-gruppen" on the inside of the capsule-membrane are probably due to
radial cleavages of the endoplasm; as also occurs in other #Collodaria#.

Spherical body limpid, somewhat opalescent, sometimes a little yellowish or
brownish, rather soft. Central capsule with a thin, but firm, transparent
membrane, its diameter eight to ten times as large as that of the central
spherical nucleus. Membrane of the nucleus thick, porous, on its inside
with some nucleoli. In the protoplasmic network between the large
intracapsular alveoles, numerous large, pale, yellowish, or orange
oil-globules. On the inside of the membrane numerous conical bodies,
centripetally directed with the apex towards the centre; every conical body
("kegelförmige centripetale Zellgruppe") composed of three to nine
(commonly four or five) nucleated cells (mother-cells of the spores?); in
the axis of the cone there is often a yellowish, orange, or brown
oil-globule. Extracapsular jelly-envelope thin, with short pseudopodia.
Xanthellæ scarce or wanting. Spicula scattered in the jelly numerous,
small, simple needles, commonly C- or S-like curved, smooth.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the whole jelly-sphere 3 to 6 mm., of the
central capsule 1 to 5 mm., of the nucleus 0.1 to 0.5, length of the
spicula 0.05 to 0.1.

  xvi., Suppl., p. 286 (162), Taf. xxxviii. (xxviii.) figs. 1-3.

Spherical body opalescent, pearl-like, with a violet or purple lustre, very
soft. Central capsule with a strong, semi-transparent membrane, its
diameter six to eight times as large as that of the central spherical
nucleus. Membrane of the nucleus very thick, porous, on its inside with
many small nucleoli. In the protoplasmic network between the alveoles very
numerous, small, purple oil-globules. On the inside of the membrane a
continuous simple layer of small nuclei, enclosed in radially striped
protoplasm (mother-cells of the spores?). No centripetal conical bodies.
Extracapsular jelly-envelope very thin, with short pseudopodia. No
xanthellæ. Spicule scattered in the jelly numerous, small needles, straight
or slightly curved, thorny owing to numerous small vertical spinules. This
species and _Thalassolampe maxima_ (p. 17) possess the largest central
capsule.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the whole jelly-sphere 8 to 12 mm., of the
central capsule 5 to 10 mm., of the nucleus 1 to 2 mm., length of the
spicula 0.1 to 0.3.

_Habitat._--Eastern Atlantic, between Canary Islands and Cape Verde
Islands, Meyen; Lanzerote, Haeckel.



{36}Genus 10. _Thalassoplancta_,[18] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p.
261.

_Definition._--#Thalassosphærida# with numerous large alveoles in the
calymma (but not in the central capsule), and with numerous simple,
needle-shaped spicula around the central capsule.

The genus _Thalassoplancta_ was founded by me in 1862 for a Radiolarian
with simple hollow needles in the calymma, which was afterwards recognised
as a Phæodarium, belonging to _Cannorrhaphis_. We here retain this name for
a true Thalassosphærid, very similar to the latter, but distinguished by
the absence of the phæodium and the solid--not hollow--needle-shaped
spicula, which are scattered in the alveolated calymma. _Thalassoplancta_
can be regarded as the solitary form of the social _Belonozoum_.[19]


1. _Thalassoplancta longispicula_, n. sp.

Spicula long and thin, cylindrical, smooth, more or less bent, pointed at
both ends, similar to those of _Thalassoplancta cavispicula_. Central
capsule thin-walled, without oil-globules, four times as broad as the
nucleus, which encloses one single nucleolus.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the capsule 0.6, of the nucleus 0.15, of the
calymma 4 mm.

_Habitat._--North Atlantic, Færöe Channel (Gulf Stream), John Murray.


2. _Thalassoplancta brevispicula_, n. sp. (Pl. 2, fig. 2).

  _Lampoxanthium brevispiculum_, Haeckel, 1882, Atlas.

Spicula short and thick, thorny, irregularly curved, pointed at both ends,
very numerous. In the observed specimen all spicula were aggregated in the
outer part of the voluminous calymma, whilst the inner alveolated part was
devoid of them. Central capsule thick walled, with a layer of large
oil-globules on its inner surface, twice as broad as the large nucleus
which contains numerous nucleoli.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the central capsule 0.5, of the nucleus 0.2, of
the calymma 2.5.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic, Station 334, surface.


Genus 11. _Lampoxanthium_,[20] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Thalassosphærida# with numerous large alveoles in the
calymma (but not in the central capsule), and with numerous branched or
compound spicula in the calymma.

{37}The genus _Lampoxanthium_ differs from the foregoing,
_Thalassoplancta_, by the composite form of the spicula, which are not
simple needles, but radiate or geminate, or branched in different forms;
the former stands therefore in the same relation to the latter as the
social _Belonozoum_ to _Sphærozoum_. The spicula of some species of
_Lampoxanthium_ are identical with those of some species of _Sphærozoum_,
so that the latter may be derived from the former by forming colonies. The
large central capsule is enveloped by a very voluminous alveolated calymma,
and includes a large central nucleus with numerous nucleoli.


Subgenus 1. _Lampoxanthella_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Spicula all (or nearly all) of one kind, radiate.


1. _Lampoxanthium tetractinium_, n. sp.

Spicula all (or nearly all) tetraradiate, with four thorny, straight,
pointed shanks, radiating from one common point. (Intermingled with these
are often some few, thorny, triradiate spicula.) On the inside of the
capsule a layer of large oil-globules as in _Thalassoplancta_, Pl. 2, fig.
2.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the central capsule 0.2, of the nucleus 0.08, of
the calymma 0.8.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 288, surface.


Subgenus 2. _Lampoxanthomma_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Spicula all (or nearly all) of one kind, geminate-radiate,
with a simple middle rod and two to four diverging shanks on each end of
it.


2. _Lampoxanthium punctatum_, n. sp.

Spicula all geminate-triradiate, thorny, of the same form as in the common
_Sphærozoum punctatum_, of which this species is the large solitary
representative. The spicula are aggregated in a very condensed layer on the
surface of the large calymma.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the capsule 0.8, of the nucleus 0.6, of the
calymma 2.0.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 248, surface.


3. _Lampoxanthium octoceras_, n. sp.

Spicula all geminate-quadriradiate, with a very short simple middle rod and
four very long divergent shanks on both ends of it; the shanks are smooth,
five to ten times as long as the middle {38}rod, irregularly bent and
curved. (Differs from the similar _Thalassoxanthium octoceras_, Pl. 2, fig.
6, by slender, more curved shanks, and by the voluminous calymma, there
entirely wanting.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the capsule 0.5, of the nucleus 0.2, of the
calymma 3.0.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic, Station 331, surface.


Subgenus 3. _Lampoxanthura_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Spicula of two or three different kinds, simple, radiate,
and geminate-radiate mixed.


4. _Lampoxanthium pandora_, n. sp. (Pl. 2, fig. 1).

Spicula mixed, of three different kinds--simple, radiate and
geminate-radiate; all three kinds partly smooth, partly thorny. The simple
needles short, thin spindle-shaped, often curved. The radiate spicula
commonly with three or four, rarely five or six, unequal rays, straight or
curved. The radiate-geminate spicula commonly with three, rarely four,
shanks on each end, often different on both ends of the middle rod. The
size, number, and form of the irregular spicula are here quite as variable
as in the social _Rhaphidozoum pandora_, of which it is the solitary
representative. The wall of the large central capsule is very thick, with
evident pore-canals, separated by a clear interval from the coagulated and
vacuolated endoplasm, which contains no oil-globules. Nucleus with numerous
nucleoli.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the central capsule 0.5 to 0.6, of the nucleus
0.1 to 0.2, of the calymma 2 to 4 mm.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 244, surface.



Family IV. #SPHÆROZOIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 4).

_Sphærozoida_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 521.

_Definition._--#Beloidea# socialia.

The family #Sphærozoida# comprises all associated or colony-forming
Radiolaria, which are provided with an imperfect skeleton, composed of
numerous solid needles or spicula, scattered around the central capsule in
the calymma. The structure and form of this skeleton is quite the same as
in the preceding solitary Thalassosphærida, but on the other hand, the
structure and form of the colonies and of the included numerous central
capsules is the same as in the skeletonless Collozoida.

The oldest well-known form of Sphærozoida is the common cosmopolitan
_Sphærozoum punctatum_, probably first observed in 1834 by Meyen, and
called _Sphærozoum fuscum_, afterwards more accurately described by Huxley
in 1851.

{39}Other forms were afterwards described by Müller and by myself in
1862.[21] Further investigations have shown me that some species of this
family are among the most common Radiolaria, and occur in astonishing
numbers on the surface of all warmer seas. But the number of species is
comparatively small, and their distinction is very difficult, as all the
different forms are very variable and connected by intermediate forms--a
truly "_transformistic_" group.

The only character sufficient for the constitution of genera in this
transformistic group is found in the form and composition of the spicula;
the very variable form of the jelly-calymma and the enclosed central
capsule being without value for this purpose. But also the form of the
spicula is very variable, and not always constant. In some species the
particular form of the spicula is transmitted by constant heredity, whilst
in others it is very inconstant, even in one and the same individual.
(Compare the remarks on variability in the general introduction.)

As the number of various forms is rather great, it seems to be advisable to
distinguish the three following genera.

Genus 13. _Sphærozoum_,[23] Meyen, 1834, Nova Acta Acad. Nat. Curios., Bd.
xvi., Suppl., p. 287 (p. 163).

_Definition._--#Sphærozoida# with branched or radiate spicula of one kind.

The genus _Sphærozoum_, with _Physematium_ one of the two oldest
Radiolaria, observed in the living state, was founded 1834 by Meyen for one
of the social #Beloidea#, which was probably the common cosmopolitan
_Sphærozoum punctatum_, the true type of this genus. Johannes Müller
described a number of species, which were partly skeletonless
(_Collozoum_), partly armed with simple or with compound spicula. The
species with simple spicula we refer here to _Belonozoum_, the species with
two or more different kinds of spicula to _Rhaphidozoum_, while we unite in
_Sphærozoum_ all species with one kind of branched or compound spicula. The
two following species are incompletely known:--_Sphærozoum orientale_,
Dana, 1863, _Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist._, vol. xii. p. 54. _Sphærozoum
sanderi_, Doenitz, 1871, L. N. 60, p. 71.

few spicula four) needle-like shanks, diverging from one common point.
Shanks straight or somewhat curved, smooth, pointed. Central capsules

the social form of _Thalassoxanthium triactinium_.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the central capsules 0.1 to 0.12, length of the
spicula-shanks 0.05 to 0.1.

diverging from one common point. Shanks slightly curved, pointed, thorny,
covered with small spinules. Central capsules ellipsoidal, containing
several (four to eight) oil-vesicles. This species may be regarded as the
social form of the solitary _Thalassoxanthium medusinum_ (Pl. 2, fig. 5).

Genus 14. _Rhaphidozoum_,[24] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 529.

_Definition._--Sphærozoida with two or more different kinds of spicula; one
kind simple, needle-shaped; the other kinds compound, radiate, or branched.

The genus _Rhaphidozoum_ differs from _Sphærozoum_ by the composition of
the skeleton of two or more different kinds of spicula, and has therefore
the same relation to it as the solitary _Lampoxanthura_ to
_Lampoxanthella_.

In some species nearly all the different forms, which characterise the
numerous species of #Beloidea#, may be united in one and the same
individual.

quadriradiate; both very thin and slender, smooth, without spicules. Simple
needles curved, C-shaped. Four shanks of the quadriradiate spicula also
curved, commonly of nearly equal size. The numerous thread-like spicula of
this species are so densely packed around the central capsule, that they
extend all around its surface like the network round a balloon.

Geminate spicula simply forked, like those of _Sphærozoum furcatum_,
composed of a short, simple, axial rod, and two simple, smooth, straight

Order II. SPHÆRELLARIA, Haeckel, 1881.

  _Sphærellaria_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 421.
  _Sphæridea_ vel _Peripylea_, Hertwig, 1879, Organismus der Radiol., p.
      133.

_Definition._--SPUMELLARIA with latticed or spongy shell.

The order #Sphærellaria#, the second order of Radiolaria, comprises all
those SPUMELLARIA in which the skeleton is a latticed or fenestrated, often
more or less spongy, siliceous shell. Originally this shell is a simple
extracapsular lattice-sphere, in which the central capsule is included;
from this simple ancestral form an enormous {50}mass of different and often
very complicated forms is derived; this order is by far the largest, and in
morphological respects the most important and most interesting, of all
Radiolaria. It contains not less than twenty-eight different families,
three hundred and five genera, and more than sixteen hundred species.

In my Monograph (1862) seven families appertaining to this group are
described--the Ethmosphærida, Cladococcida, Ommatida, Spongurida, Discida,
Lithelida, and Collosphærida. The astonishing increase of this group by the
detection of a large series of new and interesting forms, and particularly
of important connecting forms between very different branches of it, now
enables me to give a much better arrangement. I discern now four suborders
or sections of #Sphærellaria#, according to the different geometrical form
of the central capsule and of the latticed shell enveloping it. The first
of these, and the common ancestral group of the whole order, is the
#Sphæroidea#, with spherical capsule; in the #Prunoidea# it becomes
ellipsoidal or cylindrical by prolongation of one axis; in the #Discoidea#
lenticular or discoidal by shortening of one axis; in the #Larcoidea#
lentelliptical, or triaxon-ellipsoid, by different growth of the capsule in
three different "dimensive axes."

_Definition._--SPUMELLARIA with spherical central capsule (very rarely
somewhat modified, or allomorphous); with spherical fenestrated siliceous
shell (often an endospherical polyhedron, very rarely of more modified,
subspherical form or allomorphous). Growth of the shell in the three
dimensive axes equal.

The suborder #Sphæroidea#, the first and most important of the four of the
#Sphærellaria#, comprises those SPUMELLARIA in which the original
geometrical {51}spherical form is quite constantly preserved in the central
capsule, and commonly also in the fenestrated shell enveloping the latter,
although in many forms the sphere is more or less modified; very frequently
it is an "endospherical polyhedron," _i.e._, a polyhedron all the angles
(or the nodes of the network) of which lie upon the surface of a
geometrical sphere; more rarely the spherical form is more or less modified
and irregular. In the great majority of #Sphæroidea# there is no external
indication of the three dimensive axes; but in many forms they are
indicated by the regular position of certain external radial spines or
internal radial beams. However, in no case are those three axes expressed
in the form of the shell itself and of the enclosed spherical central
capsule; this is the main character by which the #Sphæroidea# differ from
the following sections:--#Prunoidea#, #Discoidea#, #Larcoidea#, all three
of which arise from them.

The section #Sphæroidea#, in the sense here restricted, was founded by me
in my Protistenreich (1878, p. 103) and adopted by Hertwig (1879) in his
Organismus der Radiolarien (p. 39). The different groups appertaining to
this large section were characterised more accurately in my Prodromus
(1881, pp. 448-456); there I gave the characters of six subfamilies with
thirty tribes, containing ninety-three genera. Formerly, in my Monograph
(1862), the #Sphæroidea# were disposed in five different
families:--Ethmosphærida, Cladococcida, Ommatida, Spongosphærida,
Collosphærida. At that time I could not separate them sufficiently from
some ACANTHARIA and PHÆODARIA, which have a similar spherical
lattice-shell.

As the number of different genera and species in the #Sphæroidea# is much
greater than in all other sections of SPUMELLARIA, many forms were already
described by former authors. In the oldest system of Ehrenberg (1847, _loc.
cit._, p. 53) they represent one part of his Haliommatina (with four
genera, _Haliomma_, _Chilomma_, _Stylosphæra_, _Spongosphæra_). Most
species, however, of these genera are #Discoidea#. Also in the latest
system of Ehrenberg (1875, _loc. cit._, p. 157) his Haliommatina are a
confused conglomeration of different SPUMELLARIA (#Sphæroidea#,
#Discoidea#, and #Prunoidea#).

The section #Sphæroidea# is the largest division of #Sphærellaria#,
comprising not less than one hundred and seven genera and six hundred and
fifty species. This enormous number (easily to be augmented by further
investigations) requires a careful disposition in different families and
subfamilies. For this disposition two different principles only can be
employed: firstly, the number and disposition of the _radial spines_;
secondly, the number of the _concentric latticed spheres_, which are
connected by radial beams. I give here the preference to the first
principle, whilst in my Prodromus (1881) I had preferred the second. The
question, which of the two principles is more important for the
classification of #Sphæroidea#, is very difficult to answer; probably in
many cases the former, in many the latter is more important for their
phylogeny.

{52}Regarding the number of the concentric shells which compose the
latticed carapace of the #Sphæroidea#, we can distinguish six families,
viz.:--

     I. Monosphærida (with one single shell).
    II. Dyosphærida (with two concentric shells).
   III. Triosphærida (with three concentric shells).
    IV. Tetrasphærida (with four concentric shells).
     V. Polysphærida (with five or more concentric shells).
    VI. Spongosphærida (with spongy shells).

On the other hand, regarding the number of the radial spines and their
regular disposition on the shell-surface, we can distinguish five families,
viz.:--

     I. Liosphærida (without radial spines).
    II. Stylosphærida (with two radial spines, opposite in one axis).
   III. Staurosphærida (with four radial spines, opposite in pairs in two
      axes, perpendicular one to another).
    IV. Cubosphærida (with six radial spines, opposite in pairs in the
      three dimensive axes).
     V. Astrosphærida (with numerous--eight, twelve, twenty, or
      more--radial spines, often more than a hundred).

All five latter groups contain representatives of all six former groups;
therefore we get together not less than thirty different subfamilies of
#Sphæroidea#, already enumerated in my Prodromus, 1881, p. 449. I repeat
them here to give a better survey of the system there employed.

{53}The #Monosphærida# comprise all those #Sphæroidea# in which the
carapace is represented only by one single lattice-shell. Originally this
shell is probably everywhere an extracapsular or "cortical shell," which is
developed on the outside of the jelly-veil enveloping the central capsule,
and serves as a protective carapace for these soft enclosed parts. But with
the progress of growth the central capsule becomes larger than the
including shell, and sends out through its pores club-shaped prolongations
or cæcal-sacs (Pl. 11, figs. 1, 5; Pl. 19, figs. 2, 3, 5; Pl. 20, fig.
1_a_; Pl. 27, fig. 3). These protruded sacs may fuse together again outside
the shell and form a spherical bladder, now enveloping the smaller shell;
the latter now becomes an intracapsular or "medullary shell."

As #Pliosphærida# (or _Sphæroidea concentrica_) we can oppose to the simple
Monosphærida all other #Sphæroidea#, the lattice-shell of which is composed
of two or more concentric shells, connected by radial beams. Probably all
Pliosphærida (or at least the greater part of them) arise from the
Monosphærida by centrifugal growth; two or more radial spines are developed
from the surface of the simple lattice-sphere, and are united together by
communicating lateral branches, developed at equal distances from the
centre; and this same process may be repeated, two, three, four, or more
times. In this way originate the characteristic systems of concentric
spheres, all united by piercing radial beams which arise from the surface
of the innermost sphere (not from its centre). Regarding this mode of
growth, we can distinguish the innermost as "original" or "primary" shell,
and all subsequent ones as "apposed" or "secondary" shells; if the number
of concentric shells amount to three or more, commonly both innermost
shells lie within the central capsule and are medullary shells, whilst all
others lie outside it and are therefore cortical shells. This difference
can be commonly recognised also in the isolated shell, without its central
capsule; the distance between the cortical and the medullary shells being
commonly much larger than the distance between the two medullary shells.

The #Dyosphærida#, or the #Sphæroidea# with two concentric shells, are the
most numerous among the Pliosphærida. Commonly in this group the inner or
primary shell lies within the central capsule as a true "medullary shell,"
whilst the outer lies outside it as a "cortical shell"; therefore the
radial beams, connecting both, pierce the wall of the capsule. But in
several forms, mainly in the peculiar group of Diplosphærida, both
concentric shells remain outside the central capsule, and both are
therefore "cortical shells."

The #Triosphærida#, or the #Sphæroidea# with three concentric shells, are
also very rich in different forms, though not so numerous by far as the
Dyosphærida. Commonly in the Triosphærida both inner shells lie within the
central capsule as "medullary shells," whilst the third lies outside it as
a "cortical shell"; therefore the central capsule remains intermediate in
size between the outer and the middle shell. But in some genera (_e.g._,
_Rhodosphæra_) both outer shells are cortical and only the {54}innermost is
a medullary shell. In this case the size of the capsule remains
intermediate between the inner and the middle shell.

The #Tetrasphærida#, or the #Sphæroidea# with four concentric shells, are
in general not frequent, and not rich in different forms. In most of the
observed species two inner shells are medullary, two outer cortical shells,
the former within, the latter without, the central capsule; and the wall of
the capsule, pierced by the connecting radial beams, lies between the two
middle shells. But there are some Tetrasphærida in which all four shells
seem to be external or cortical shells.

The #Polysphærida#, or the #Sphæroidea# with five or more concentric
shells, seem of course to offer the greatest possibility for the
development of very different forms; but in reality this group is the
poorest and smallest of all; and only one part of it, the Arachnosphærida,
is rather common. In this peculiar division the shell is composed of five
to ten or more, very delicate, cobweb-like concentric shells, which are
connected by radial beams; all are cortical shells, and lie outside the
central capsule. Much more rare are those Polysphærida, in which both
innermost shells, as true medullary shells, lie within the central capsule,
all others being outside it. The total number of concentric shells in this
group is commonly between five and ten, rarely more.

The #Spongosphærida# are distinguished from all other #Sphæroidea# by the
spongy structure of the spherical shell, which is composed wholly or
partially of an irregular spongy framework. The relation of this group to
the other groups of #Sphæroidea# is probably rather complicated, for in
some Spongosphærida the whole shell is composed of massive spongy
reticulation, whilst in others it contains a spherical central cavity, and
in a third group this cavity is filled up by one or two concentric
lattice-shells, connected by radial beams. Many of these Spongosphærida are
very common, and of considerable size.

The #Collosphærida# form a peculiar separate group of #Sphæroidea#,
distinguished from all others by their social life or aggregation in
colonies (coenobia). They represent the only group of #Sphærellaria# in
which this association of numerous individual capsules or cells is
realised. The shell is almost constantly simple, without regularly disposed
radial spines; therefore they may be called "social Monosphærida," or
better "polyzoic Ethmosphærida." Only in one small group (Clathrosphærida)
the shell, enveloping every central capsule, is double or surrounded by an
external mantle; these may be compared to the Diplosphærida (or better to a
part of the Carposphærida, _Liosphæra_, p. 76). In most of the
Collosphærida the lattice-shell is more or less irregular in form and
structure.


_The Lattice Work_ of the fenestrated shells is in the #Sphæroidea# of the
greatest variability, and its innumerable modifications serve mainly for
the distinction of species. In general we can distinguish as the most
important modifications a _regular_ network (with equal size, form, and
distance of the pores or meshes) and an _irregular_ network (with
{55}differences in the size, form, or distance of the meshes or pores). In
both groups the pores may be either angular or round; so that there may
exist together four different main forms of network--(A) regular lattice
with equal hexagonal pores; (B) regular lattice with equal circular pores;
(C) irregular lattice with unequal polygonal pores; (D) irregular lattice
with unequal roundish pores. Besides these modifications, the pores may be
prolonged into tubules which are directed radially towards the outside
(rarely towards the inside) of the sphere. In other cases they are
surrounded by elevated or honeycomb-like frames.

_The Radial Spines_ exhibit in the #Sphæroidea# the greatest variety in
form, size, disposition, &c., and their numerous modifications serve mainly
for the distinction of genera, their peculiar formation and size also for
the distinction of species. In general we may distinguish as the most
important modifications primary and secondary spines. The primary spines or
"main spines" are commonly direct outward prolongations of the internal
radial beams, connecting the concentric shells. The secondary or
"by-spines" arise only from the surface of the lattice-shell, without
reference to the internal beams. The by-spines are commonly smaller, and
much more numerous than the main spines. Regarding the form, the radial
spines are either roundish (cylindrical or conical, often also club-shaped,
rarely spindle-shaped) or angular (commonly three-sided, prismatic or
pyramidal). The spines are constantly solid, never hollow; the "internal
canals," described by some authors, are only microscopic views of the
transparent edges. In many cases the spines are branched or forked. The
most important difference in the variable shape of the spines is their
regular or irregular number and disposition, which afford characters for
the distinction of our five families.

_The Three Dimensive Axes_--or the three diameters of the sphere,
perpendicular one to another--are in the great majority of the #Sphæroidea#
significant in the promorphological consideration of the body, and are
indicated either by the position of the external radial spines, or at least
of the internal radial beams, connecting the concentric spheres. Commonly
two radial spines are placed opposite in each axis. The most perfect group
in this respect seems to be that of the Cubosphærida, in which the three
axes are represented by three pairs of spines. Next come the
Staurosphærida, in which two axes in cross-form are exhibited by two pairs
of spines. The most simple group are the Stylosphærida, in which only one
pair of spines is developed, indicating one single axis. These three
families form together a continuous natural series,--the #Sphæroidea# with
real dimensive axes,--and exhibit at the same time relations to the three
other suborders of #Sphærellaria#, the #Larcoidea#, #Discoidea#, and
#Prunoidea# respectively. At both ends of this series stand two other
families, on one side the Liosphærida, without any radial spines on the
surface of the sphere, on the other side the Astrosphærida, in which the
radial spines are developed in great and variable numbers, at least eight
to twelve, commonly twenty to forty, often more than a hundred or even a
thousand.

{56}The #Liosphærida# comprise all those #Sphæroidea# in which the surface
of the shell is smooth, without radial spines (Pls. 12, 20). The simplest
of these are the Ethmosphærida, with one single lattice-shell, enveloping
the spherical central capsule. _Cenosphæra_, the most simple form of the
Ethmosphærida, may be regarded as the common ancestral form of all
#Sphæroidea#, in an ontogenetical as well as in a phylogenetical and
morphological sense. From this simple lattice sphere all other #Sphæroidea#
can be derived either by radial or by tangential growth. If the radial
beams, arising from the surface of the simple fenestrated sphere, become
connected (at equal distances from the centre) by tangential beams, we get
the compound shells of the "Liosphærida concentrica" (with two, three,
four, or more concentric spheres). The radial beams connecting these
exhibit in many Liosphærida the same regular disposition and number as the
external radial spines in the Astrosphærida. Perhaps these forms in a
"natural system" would be better united (_e.g._, Liosphærida with twelve or
twenty internal radial beams, and Astrosphærida with twelve or twenty
external radial spines); but in many cases (mainly for higher numbers) the
certain determination of their number and disposition is very difficult or
quite impossible.

The #Cubosphærida# (Pls. 21-25) represent the large and very important
family of #Sphæroidea#, in which all three dimensive axes are equally
distinguished by pairs of spines, corresponding to three axes of a cube or
of a regular octahedron, agreeing therefore also with the three axes of the
cubic or regular crystalline system. In the majority of the Cubosphærida
the six radial spines are accurately opposite each other in pairs in three
axes, perpendicular one to another, and commonly they are of equal size and
form; but in some genera the three pairs of spines become differentiated,
whilst both spines of each pair remain equal. Either one pair is larger
than the two others (which are equal), corresponding to the axes of the
quadratic crystalline system; or all three pairs are different
(corresponding to the three unequal axes of the rhombic crystalline
system); the former nearer to the #Discoidea#, the latter to the
#Larcoidea#. We may suppose with some probability, that the Cubosphærida
are for the most part the common ancestral group of those #Sphæroidea#, in
which a certain number of radial spines or beams is disposed in a regular
order; the Staurosphærida may be derived from them by loss of one pair of
spines, the Stylosphærida by loss of two pairs of spines, and most
Astrosphærida by multiplying the radial spines, six to fourteen or more
secondary spines being added to the six primary "dimensive spines."
However, in many Astrosphærida (_e.g._, in those with eight spines,
_Centrocubus_, _Octodendron_, &c.) the regular geometrical disposition of
the radial spines seems to follow another mathematical order, quite
independent of the Cubosphærida.

The #Staurosphærida# (Pl. 15) are distinguished by the possession of four
radial spines, opposite in pairs in two axes, perpendicular one to another.
This rectangular cross determines a certain plane, the "equatorial plane,"
and this brings the Staurosphærida near {57}to the #Discoidea#, mainly to
those which also bear on the periphery of the circular equatorial plane
four crossed spines (such as _Staurodisculus_, _Stethostaurus_,
_Staurodictya_, &c.). But in these cruciform #Discoidea# the shell and the
enclosed central capsule are discoidal or lenticular, whilst in the
Staurosphærida they remain spherical. Commonly the cross is quite regular,
with four right angles and four equal beams; but often also it becomes more
or less irregular. In some genera one pair of equal opposite spines is
larger than the other pair. These forms represent the three different axes
of the rhombic crystal system, whilst the common regular Staurosphærida
represent those of the quadratic crystal system. The latter can be derived
from the Cubosphærida (representing the regular crystal system) by
reduction of one axis and loss of its pair of spines. In general the number
of species (and particularly of the individuals) is much smaller in the
Staurosphærida than in all other families of #Sphæroidea#.

The #Stylosphærida# (Pls. 13-17) can be derived from the Cubosphærida by
reduction of two dimensive axes and loss of two pairs of spines. Therefore,
here one pair of spines only is developed, opposite in one single axis.
This "monaxonial" form brings the Stylosphærida very near to the
ellipsoidal #Prunoidea# (mainly to many two-spined forms of Ellipsida and
Druppulida); but they differ from these by the spherical (not ellipsoidal)
form of the central capsule and of the enclosing lattice-shell. In the
greater part of the Stylosphærida both spines are of equal size and form,
accurately opposite in the "main axis." But in many forms both spines
become unequal in size or form, often very different. More rarely they are
not accurately opposed, but placed in two different axes, intersecting at a
small variable angle. The small group of Saturnalida presents a very
remarkable and peculiar structure, in which both spines (at equal distances
from the centre) are united by a circular or elliptical ring (Pl. 13, figs.
15, 16; Pl. 16, figs. 16, 17).

The #Astrosphærida# are distinguished from the other #Sphæroidea# by the
great and variable number of their external radial spines (Pls. 11, 18-20,
26-30). Commonly this number amounts to from twelve to twenty, rarely to
only eight to ten, very often to thirty-two to forty or more; in many
species more than one hundred are present. As already mentioned above, it
would be important to distinguish between primary spines (as outer
prolongations of the inner radial beams) and secondary spines (developed
from the surface of the shell), but in many cases this distinction is
difficult or impossible. More practical is the distinction between larger
"main spines" and smaller "by-spines." The size and form of the radial
spines is extremely variable. Much more important is their number and
disposition. In general we can here distinguish the following different
cases:--(A) radial spines are developed from all the nodal points of the
network on the shell surface; (B) the number of the spines is smaller than
that of the nodal points, but they are irregularly scattered; (C) the
radial spines exhibit a limited number and a certain regular disposition.
In this latter case the following modes of distribution seem to be the most
important:--(_a_) eight spines placed in the four diagonal axes of the
{58}regular cube (Pl. 18, figs. 1-3); (_b_) twelve spines (placed in the
corner axes of the regular icosahedron); (_c_) fourteen spines (six placed
in the three dimensive axes of the regular octahedron, eight in the centres
of its eight faces); (_d_) twenty spines (placed either in the same order
as in many #Larcoidea# and ACANTHARIA [?], or in the twenty corners of the
regular dodecahedron); (_e_) thirty-two spines (twelve placed in the twelve
corners of the regular icosahedron, twenty in the centre of its triangular
faces). Besides these most important and quite geometrical modes of
disposition there also seem to occur in the Astrosphærida the following
subregular (or symmetrical?) modes: 9, 10, 16, 18, 24, 40, 60, 80. But it
is very difficult to give a correct account of these modes. In every case
this manifold and regular disposition of the radial spines is of the
highest interest for the study of general "Promorphology."


_The Central Capsule_ is in all #Sphæroidea# (without any exception) a
perfect sphere in the geometrical sense, even in those forms in which the
enclosing lattice-shell is more or less irregular (_i.e._, many
Collosphærida). This is the most important character, which separates the
#Sphæroidea# from all other #Sphærellaria#. For in the #Prunoidea# the
capsule is ellipsoidal, with one prolonged axis; in the #Discoidea#
lenticular, with one shortened axis; in the #Larcoidea# lentelliptical,
with three different dimensive axes. The central capsule is originally
always enclosed by the lattice-shell; but in many cases with increasing
growth this relation becomes inverted; the capsule sending out many
club-shaped blind sacs through the meshes of the lattice-shell, and these
melting together outside the latter, a new membrane is formed, enclosing a
"medullary shell."

_The Nucleus_ of the cell exhibits a very different shape in the solitary
and the social #Sphæroidea#. In the solitary or monozoic #Sphæroidea# the
centre of the central capsule is occupied by a large spherical concentric
nucleus, with or without nucleoli; also this nucleus is originally always
within the innermost lattice-shell, but with increasing size may overgrow
and enclose it. A short time before the formation of the vibratile spores
the central nucleus becomes resolved into many small nuclei. In the social
or polyzoic #Sphæroidea#--the Collosphærida--commonly the simple central
nucleus very early (a long time before the formation of the spores) is
divided into a great number of small nuclei, whilst the centre of the
capsule becomes filled with a large oil-globule. Therefore we find the same
difference between the solitary and social forms in the #Sphæroidea# as in
the #Colloidea#. Here also the calymma, or the jelly-mantle, enveloping the
central capsule, is in the social forms very large and voluminous,
differentiated into alveoles, whilst in the solitary forms it is much
smaller, without alveoles.

Family V. #LIOSPHÆRIDA#, Haeckel, 1881.

_Liosphærida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 449.

_Definition._--#Sphæroidea# without radial spines on the surface of the
spherical shell; living solitary (not associated in colonies).

The family #Liosphærida# comprises all those solitary #Sphæroidea# in which
the surface of the spherical shell is not armed with radial spines. Nearly
the half of this large group is formed by the Ethmosphærida, in which the
carapace is a quite simple, spherical lattice-shell; this subfamily is
probably the common ancestral group from which all other #Sphæroidea#, or
even all #Sphærellaria#, can be derived in a phylogenetical as well as in a
morphological sense. The central capsule in this first subfamily is
constantly enclosed by the fenestrated shell, and separated from it by the
jelly-veil. The shell is therefore an extracapsular or medullary shell.

To these simple Ethmosphærida all other subfamilies can be opposed as
"Liosphærida concentrica," as their carapace is composed of two or more
concentric lattice-shells; two in the Carposphærida, three in the
Thecosphærida, four in the Cromyosphærida, five or more in the
Caryosphærida. In all these four subfamilies the concentric shells are
simple (not spongy) fenestrated shells. In a sixth subfamily, in the
Plegmosphærida, the shell is wholly or partially composed of spongy
wicker-work, with or without a latticed medullary shell in the centre.

The internal radial beams, in the "Liosphærida composita" connecting the
concentric spheres, exhibit in their number and disposition similar
important differences, such as the external radial spines in the
Astrosphærida. The following eight {60}different cases of regular
disposition were observed:--(A) two opposite beams in one axis; (B) four
beams, opposite in pairs in two axes perpendicular one to another; (C) six
beams, opposite in pairs in the three dimensive axes; (D) eight beams,
opposite in pairs in the four diagonals of the regular cube; (E) twelve
beams corresponding to the twelve axes of the regular icosahedron; (F)
fourteen beams quite regularly disposed (six corresponding to the three
axes of the regular octahedron, eight to the central points of its faces);
(G) twenty beams (probably corresponding to the twenty corners of a regular
dodecahedron); (H) thirty-two beams, regularly disposed. Rarely the number
of the radial beams is intermediate between these eight cases, and rarely
it is higher; then commonly the disposition is irregular. The regularity of
their disposition in the great majority of cases is very remarkable and
evident.

Genus 15. _Cenosphæra_,[26] Ehrenberg, 1854, Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad.

_Definition._--#Liosphærida# with one single latticed sphere, with simple
shell-pores (not prolonged into free tubuli) and with simple shell-cavity
(without internal radial beams).

The genus _Cenosphæra_ is the most simple form of all SPHÆROIDEA, and may
be regarded as the common ancestral form of this order. The siliceous
latticed shell, in which the central capsule is enclosed, represents a
simple regular sphere, with simple cavity. The pores of the shell-wall are
simple, not prolonged into radial tubuli (as in _Ethmosphæra_ and
_Sethosphæra_). According to the different form of the pores, the numerous
species of this genus can be disposed in four different subgenera. Some
species may be easily confounded with isolated shells of the corresponding
social _Collosphæra_; but in this latter the spherical shell-form is
commonly more or less irregular, in _Cenosphæra_ quite regular.



Subgenus 1. _Phormosphæra_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 448.

_Definition._--Pores of the shell regular or subregular, hexagonal or
circular, with hexagonal frames or lobes; all nearly of equal size and
form.


1. _Cenosphæra primordialis_, n. sp.

Shell very thin walled, smooth. Pores hexagonal, regular, or subregular;
twelve to fifteen on the half meridian of the shell; bars between them
extremely delicate (only visible when three hundred or four hundred times
enlarged). Diameter of the shell nine to ten times that of the meshes. This
species is remarkable for the extreme delicacy of the arachnoidal network
of the simple spherical shell; it may be regarded as the common ancestral
form of all #Sphæroidea#. The shell equals that of _Heliosphæra tenuissima_
(figured in my Monograph, 1862, pl. ix. fig. 2), but differs from it by the
smooth surface and the absence of all spines or thorns. I observed this
species living in the Indian Ocean, near Ceylon, in 1882; the spherical
diameter of the central capsule is about one-third of that of the shell;
the contents of the central capsule are colourless {62}and transparent,
except the central dark globular nucleus. The same shells also occur in
some mounted preparations of surface organisms from the Challenger.

Genus 16. _Stigmosphæra_,[27] Haeckel, n. gen.

_Definition._--#Liosphærida# with one single latticed sphere, with simple
shell-pores (not prolonged into free tubuli); in the central point of the
spherical shell-cavity are united a number of radial beams, which become
forked and inserted into the inner surface of the shell by their distal
ends.

The genus _Stigmosphæra_ differs from _Cenosphæra_ (and from all other
Monosphærida) by internal radial beams, which are united in the centre of
the simple spherical shell; these beams are branched, and the distal ends
of the branches inserted on the internal surface of the shell. I have
observed only two, nearly identical specimens of this genus, both with
regular, hexagonal pores and thin bars; the beams were implanted in the
corners of the hexagons. In one specimen the surface was covered with short
radial bristles, whilst these in the other specimen were prolonged into
radial spines (like _Acanthosphæra_). Possibly this peculiar genus is
derived from _Carposphæra_, by reduction and loss of a central medullary
shell.


_Stigmosphæra actinocentra_, n. sp.

Shell very thin walled, rough, with regular circular, hexagonally framed
pores, six times as broad as the bars, eight to ten on the quadrant; in the
corner of each hexagon a small bristle. In {69}the central point of the
shell are united about twelve (?) thin and straight radial beams, which are
forked, with dichotomous branches; the distal ends of the branches are
inserted in the corners of the hexagons on the inside of the shell.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.15, pores 0.02, bars 0.003.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.



Genus 17. _Ethmosphæra_,[28] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 349.

_Definition._--#Liosphærida# with one single latticed sphere, with simple
shell-cavity; with shell-pores which are prolonged on the outside in
centrifugal, conical, or cylindrical tubuli.

The genus _Ethmosphæra_ differs from the simple _Cenosphæra_, its ancestral
form, by the peculiar formation of the shell-pores; in all observed species
of the genus these are quite regular, of nearly equal size and form; their
base in the spherical shell-face is hexagonal, but on the outside prolonged
into centrifugal, external, radial tubuli, which are either conical or
cylindrical (in the latter case both openings of the tubes being equal, in
the former the outer opening being smaller than the inner). The solitary
_Ethmosphæra_ corresponds to the social _Siphonosphæra_; but in the former
the formation of the shell and of its tubuli is quite regular, in the
latter more or less irregular.

Genus 18. _Sethosphæra_,[29] Hæckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 452 (_sensu
emendato_).

_Definition._--#Liosphærida# with one single latticed sphere, with simple
shell-cavity; with shell-pores, which are prolonged on the inside into
centripetal, conical, or cylindrical tubuli.

The genus _Sethosphæra_ differs from its ancestral form, _Cenosphæra_, by
the production of internal, centripetal, radial tubuli on the inside of the
shell (the contrary of the preceding genus _Ethmosphæra_). It corresponds
therefore to the social _Pharyngosphæra_; but in the latter the formation
of the shell and its tubes is more or less irregular, whilst in the former
each regular pore is prolonged into a regular tubule.

length of the tubuli 0.02.

Subfamily CARPOSPHÆRIDA,[30] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 449.

_Definition._--#Liosphærida# with two concentric spherical lattice-shells,
which are united by radial beams.


_Carposphæra_,[31] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 451.

_Definition._--Liosphærida with one medullary (intracapsular) and one
cortical (extracapsular) shell, both connected by radial beams piercing the
central capsule.

{72}The genus _Carposphæra_ comprises a large number of double-shelled
#Sphæroidea#, formerly united with _Haliomma_, but different from this
genus by the absence of radial spines. The shell is composed of two
concentric latticed spheres, the inner of which (or the medullary shell) is
situated within the central capsule, the other (or the cortical shell)
outside it. Both shells are connected by radial beams which pierce the wall
of the central capsule. The distance between the shells is at least as
large as (commonly much larger than) the radius of the inner shell, whilst
in the following genus, _Liosphæra_, that distance is much smaller than
this radius.

Genus 20. _Liosphæra_,[32] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 449.

_Definition._--#Liosphærida# with two cortical (extracapsular) shells
(without a medullary or intracapsular shell).

The genus _Liosphæra_ agrees with the preceding _Carposphæra_ in the
possession of two concentric latticed spheres; but whilst in the latter
genus the inner sphere is a medullary one (intracapsular), the outer a
cortical shell (extracapsular), both connected by radial beams piercing the
capsule-wall, here in _Liosphæra_ the central capsule lies freely within
the inner lattice shell and is not pierced by radial beams. Therefore both
shells are here cortical shells, both separated by a distance, which is
constantly much smaller than the radius of the inner shell; whereas in
_Carposphæra_ this distance is at least as large as that radius (commonly
much larger). In _Carposphæra_ the number of pores in both shells is never
the same; in several species of _Liosphæra_ this number is the same, each
outer regular hexagonal pore exactly corresponding to an inner; the six
corners of each connected by six short radial beams.



Subgenus 1. _Melitomma_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Pores of both shells regular, in each shell all of nearly
equal size and form.

Both shells with the same number of pores, exactly corresponding, about ten
on the quadrant. {77}All pores regular, or subregular, hexagonal; the outer
twice as broad as the inner. Outer bars very thin, thread-like; inner bars
thick, one-third as broad as the pores. Surface smooth. Both shells
connected by numerous radial beams, their distance one-third as large as
the radius of the inner shell.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the outer shell 0.16, inner 0.12, distance of
both 0.02; outer pores 0.014, inner pores 0.007.

circular, with elegant six-lobed frames, twice as broad as the bars; the
outer hexagonal, with very thin thread-like bars. All corners of the outer
and inner hexagons connected by thin, bristle-shaped radial beams. (Similar
to _Haliomma rhodococcus_, Pl. 19, fig. 6; but with smooth surface and
regular hexagonal pores of the outer shell.)

3. _Liosphæra porulosa_, n. sp.

Both shells with regular hexagonal pores; their number in the outer shell
seven times as great as in the inner. Pores of the stout inner shell large,
three times as broad as the bars, about eight on the quadrant. From each
hexagon-corner arises one bristle-shaped radial beam; their distal ends are
united by threads (three from each), forming the large meshes of the
delicate outer shell. Each of these is divided by very thin threads into
seven small circular porules, one central and six around it.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the outer shell 0.25, inner 0.2, distance of
both 0.025; outer pores 0.04, their porules 0.012, inner pores 0.15.

4. _Liosphæra peridromium_, n. sp.

Both shells with the same number of large, polygonal, very irregular pores,
exactly corresponding (about eight to ten on the quadrant); both with a
very delicate thin framework. From the thread-like bars of the inner, very
large and thin-walled, sphere arise perpendicularly innumerable short
bristles of equal length, which are united at equal distances by tangential
thread-like bars, parallel to the former, composing the outer shell. Each
mesh is, therefore, surrounded by a delicate ballister or rail.

the bars between them; twenty to thirty on the quadrant. The pores of the
outer shell somewhat smaller, therefore much more numerous than the pores
of the inner shell. Distance between the two shells about one-third as
great as the radius of the inner. Both shells connected by numerous thin
radial beams. Surface smooth or a little rough.

_Definition._--#Liosphærida# with two medullary (intracapsular) shells and
one cortical (extracapsular) shell.

The genus _Thecosphæra_ comprises a large number of triple-shelled
#Sphæroidea#, formerly united with _Actinomma_, but different from this
genus in the absence of radial spines. The latticed shell is composed of
three concentric spheres, two of which lie within the central capsule
(medullary shells), and one outside (cortical shell). This latter is
connected with the former by radial beams piercing the wall of the central
capsule. From the following _Rhodosphæra_ (with one medullary and two
cortical shells) _Carposphæra_ differs also by the distance of the three
shells. In the former the distance between the two outer shells is much
smaller, in the latter much larger, than the distance between the inner
shells.

arise from the hexagon-corners; these short conical spines are connected at
the distal end (at equal distances from the centre) by delicate threads

{92}Family VI. #COLLOSPHÆRIDA#, J. Müller[45] (Pls. 5-8).

_Definition._--#Sphæroidea# living associated in colonies, united by an
alveolar jelly-body, and connected by the network of anastomosing
pseudopodia.

The family #Collosphærida# comprises all polyzous or social #Sphæroidea#,
and constitutes the only polyzoic group among the SPHÆRELLARIA. This group
was first constituted by J. Müller as "_Radiolaria polyzoa_ with
shells."[46] Formerly following his authority, in my Monograph I had
separated them from the other #Sphæroidea# and united them with the social
Collodaria (Sphærozoida).[47] Also R. Hertwig in his Organismus der
Radiolarien[48] united them with his Sphærozoea. In my Prodromus[49] I had
retained this isolated position. But a further careful study has convinced
me that this isolation is not truly natural, and that the Collosphærida are
only "social Ethmosphærida" which have arisen from this solitary subfamily
by adaptation to colonial life. There are some forms of Collosphærida which
are nearly identical with some forms of Ethmosphærida, only differing from
the latter by their association in colonies; and in some forms of both
groups it is quite impossible to decide whether the isolated shells
appertain to one or to the other family.

The isolated shell of the Collosphærida is almost constantly (with few
exceptions) a simple extracapsular lattice-shell, as in the Monosphærida;
only the small group of Clathrosphærida (with the genera _Clathrosphæra_
and _Xanthiosphæra_) exhibit an exception, the simple lattice-shell being
overgrown by an external mantle or veil of very thin, cobweb-like,
irregular lattice-work (Pl. 8, figs. 6-11). Therefore these Clathrosphærida
bear to the Acrosphærida (or the common simple Collosphærida) a relation
similar to that which _Liosphæra_ (p. 76) bears to _Cenosphæra_; both
shells are extracapsular "cortical shells" at a very short distance apart.
In the Collosphærida true concentric medullary shells never occur; the
central capsule always lies quite freely in the simple or double cortical
shell, separated from it by a jelly-veil.

Although a well marked difference in the simple lattice-shell of the social
Collosphærida and the solitary Ethmosphærida does not exist, nevertheless
in most cases the two shells can be distinguished by a practiced observer.
The simple fenestrated shells of the monozoic Ethmosphærida are commonly
quite regular spheres in a mathematical sense, or regular "endospherical
polyhedra"; whereas in the Collosphærida they are commonly more or less
irregular, often to an extraordinary degree (Pls. 5-8). Some species of
Collosphærida, however, also possess quite regular spherical shells.
Another difference is often shown in the lattice-work of the shells, which
in the Collosphærida is nearly always very irregular, and exhibits a
peculiar tendency to the {93}production of radial, conical, or cylindrical
tubules. These occur as well on the inside as on the outside of the shell,
and the tubules are now more conical, now more cylindrical; their wall
either solid or pierced by pores (Pls. 5-8). The tubules are commonly very
irregular in form, size, and disposition; distinguished, however, by a
number of hereditary peculiarities, which are sufficient for the
distinction of genera. Similar tubules occur also in some genera of
solitary Ethmosphærida (_Coscinomma_, _Ethmosphæra_, _Conosphæra_, &c., Pl.
12); but the tubules are here much more regular and not so highly
developed.

Besides the tubules of the fenestrated shells, in some genera of
Collosphærida the surface is armed with irregular thorns, rarely with more
regular radial spines. But these spines obtain constantly the character of
accessory by-spines, and remain short and thin. In this family typical
radial spines never occur in a regular and characteristic disposition,
corresponding to dimensive axes, as is the case in nearly all solitary
#Sphæroidea#, only excepting the Liosphærida. Commonly these spines or
thorns serve as protective arms for the shell-meshes, surrounding them
often in the form of coronels. Often the lattice-plate of the irregular
roundish shell is tubercular, elevated into irregular protuberances,
bearing on the top a short spine or thorn (Pl. 8).

The _Central Capsule_ of the Collosphærida is always a regular sphere, as
in all other #Sphæroidea#; it is constantly placed within the
lattice-shell, and commonly much smaller than it, separated from it by a
thick jelly-veil. A remarkable difference from the solitary #Sphæroidea# is
shown in the early division of the nucleus. Commonly the central capsule of
the Collosphærida contains in its centre a large oil-globule, surrounded by
very numerous small nuclei. R. Hertwig estimated this difference as so
important, that he separated the social "Sphærozoea" and the solitary
"Peripylea" as two different orders. As already shown above (p. 7, 24), we
cannot support this separation, and are now convinced that this difference
in the development of the spores--just as in the #Collodaria#--is the
consequence of an adaptation to social life.

The common jelly-body, in which the numerous central capsules and their
enveloping shells are united, exhibits in the Collosphærida quite the same
characters as in the other social Radiolaria, the Collozoida and
Sphærozoida. The jelly-body is very voluminous, commonly spherical, often
cylindrical, of considerable size; constantly containing numerous large
alveoles. Often each shell is enclosed in a separate alveole with rather
solid wall (Pl. 6, fig. 2). Sometimes in the dead colonies all shells are
united in the central part of the jelly-body, whilst its peripheral part is
composed of a stratum of large alveoles (Pl. 8, fig. 11); at other times no
alveoles are visible (Pl. 7, fig. 11). In many living colonies I found a
very large spherical alveole with thick wall in the centre of the spherical
colony, surrounded by many strata of delicate thin-walled alveoles (Pl. 5,
fig. 1).  In this case often the inner younger capsules were naked,
{94}without shells, the outer only surrounded by shells. Already in my
Monograph I had described the same peculiar formation.[50]

central capsule of the coenobium.



{95}Genus 29. _Collosphæra_,[51] J. Müller, 1855.

_Definition._--#Collosphærida# with simple shells, smooth on the inside and
on the outside, without any spines or tubuli.

The genus _Collosphæra_ is the most simple form of all Collosphærida, and
must be regarded as the common ancestral form of this family. As the
lattice-shell is quite a simple sphere, without any spines, tubules, or
other peculiar productions, it agrees perfectly with _Cenosphæra_, and
represents the social or polyzoid aggregate of this solitary or monozoid
genus. Therefore a certain distinction between the isolated shells of the
two genera is often very difficult or even impossible; but commonly this
distinction is possible owing to the circumstance, that in the majority of
the _Collosphæræ_ the shell is more or less irregular roundish or
polyhedral, not quite spherical, as in _Cenosphæra_. _Dermatosphæra_,
Ehrenberg, is a _Collosphæra_ with small pores (compare L. N. 16, p. 533).

{98}Genus 30. _Tribonosphæra_,[52] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 471.

_Definition._--#Collosphærida# with simple shells, on the inside with
radial centripetal beams.

The genus _Tribonosphæra_ differs from _Collosphæra_ by a very peculiar and
rare character, the development of centripetal radial sticks on the
internal face of the shell; these beams are not united in the centrum, but
finish freely in a certain distance from it.

Shell roundish or subspherical, with numerous small circular or roundish
pores, about twice as broad as the bars. Twenty to thirty pores on the half
meridian of the shell. Outside of the shell smooth, inside a variable
number (ten to twenty) of thin, radial, centripetal sticks or spines,
one-third or one-half as long as the radius of the shell. (In the central
capsule many very large crystals, resting after the destruction of the
capsule.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.1 to 0.12, of the pores 0.003 to
0.005, of the bridges 0.001 to 0.002; length of the inner centripetal

Genus 31. _Pharyngosphæra_,[53] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Collosphærida# with simple shells, having on the inside
radial centripetal tubes, the walls of which are solid.

The genus _Pharyngosphæra_ differs from _Collosphæra_ by the development of
radial tubules on the inside of the shell, which are directed centripetally
towards its centre. The wall of the tubule is solid, not latticed as in the
following genus.


1. _Pharyngosphæra stomodæa_, n. sp. (Pl. 5, fig. 10).

_Definition._--#Collosphærida# with simple shells, having on the inside
radial centripetal tubes, the walls of which are fenestrated.

The genus _Buccinosphæra_ exhibits, on the inner surface of the shell,
radial centripetal tubules similar to those of the foregoing
_Pharyngosphæra_; but the walls of these tubes are here latticed, not
solid; they represent therefore true invaginations of the whole shell-wall.


1. _Buccinosphæra invaginata_, n. sp. (Pl. 5, fig. 11).

Shell irregular roundish or nearly polyhedral, with a variable number of
umbilical depressions, which are prolonged on the inside into cylindrical
or somewhat conical, centripetal, fenestrated tubes, about one-third as
long as the shell radius. Inner mouth of the tubes narrower, scarcely half
as broad as the outer mouth, about equal to one-fourth the shell radius,
truncated. Pores of the tubes and of the shell small, roundish, irregular
in size and distribution, about as broad as the bars. Twenty-five to thirty
pores in the half meridian of the shell. In all observed specimens the
spherical central capsule (half as broad as the shell) contained a large
number of crystals.

Shell irregular polyhedral with rounded edges, with a variable number of
umbilical depressions, which are prolonged on the inside into large, nearly
cylindrical, centripetal, fenestrated tubes, half as long as the shell
radius. In the middle the tubes are somewhat constricted and narrower.
Inner mouth of the tubes dilated, nearly as broad as the outer mouth, about
equal to one-half the shell-radius, truncated. Pores of the tubes and of
the shell large, roundish polygonal, irregular in size and distribution,
three to four times as broad as the bars. Fifteen to twenty pores in the
half meridian of the shell.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.12 to 0.14, of the pores 0.008 to
0.012, of the bars 0.002 to 0.004; length of the tubuli 0.03; outer mouth
0.04, inner mouth 0.03.

_Definition._--#Collosphærida# with simple shells, the outer surface of
which is covered with radial, irregularly scattered spines.

{100}The genus _Acrosphæra_ differs from its ancestral genus _Collosphæra_

Shell a regular sphere, everywhere covered with small, very numerous,
straight radial spines, regularly scattered between the pores. In the half

bears single scattered spines, one single spine on the margin of each
larger pore.

The genus _Odontosphæra_ is distinguished from the foregoing _Acrosphæra_

_Definition._--#Collosphærida# with simple shells, the pores of which are
prolonged into external simple radial tubuli with fenestrated wall; outer
mouth of the tubuli truncated, smooth.

The genus _Solenosphæra_ differs from _Siphonosphæra_ in the fenestration
of the external radial tubes. A large number of shells, appertaining to
this genus, were already described by Ehrenberg, and disposed in five
different genera corresponding to the {113}different numbers of the
tubuli:--_Disolenia_ with two tubes, _Trisolenia_ with three tubes,
_Tetrasolenia_ with four tubes, _Pentasolenia_ with five tubes,
_Polysolenia_ with six or more tubes. All these five genera are without
value, as those different numbers of tubes occur frequently intermingled in
the individual cells of one and the same colony, wherever the form and
structure of the tubes is inherited with sufficient constancy to determine
the species.



Subgenus 1. _Solenosphactra_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Tubuli of the shell cylindrical or nearly cylindrical, the
outer and inner apertures nearly of the same size.

of the tubuli commonly as broad as the half radius of the shell (or

The genus _Clathrosphæra_ (with smooth surface) and the following
_Xanthiosphæra_ (with spiny surface) form together the small subfamily,
Clathrosphærida, different from the other Collosphærida by the double
lattice-shell. From the surface of the inner primary shell arise either
solid spines or hollow tubes, which unite by the anastomosis of irregular
branches and so form the outer secondary shell, often very incomplete and
irregular. All Clathrosphærida seem to inhabit great depths.

Inner shell spherical, with irregular roundish large meshes, now broader
now smaller than their bars. Eight to ten meshes in the half meridian of
the shell. All these meshes are prolonged into short cylindrical hollow
tubes, about as long as broad, somewhat constricted in the middle. From the
margins of the outer openings of these tubes proceed very numerous and
delicate siliceous filaments, which all lie on the same spherical face,
branch, anastomose, and twine over the openings and the intervals between
them, forming a very thin, arachnoid spherical outer shell. The meshes of
this are quite irregular polygonal, of very different size and form. The

Inner shell spherical, with irregular roundish meshes, two or three times
as broad as the bars. Ten to twelve meshes in the half meridian of the
shell. From its surface arise numerous conical radial spines (with base

Inner shell spherical or subspherical, with irregular roundish meshes,
about half as broad as the bars. Twelve to sixteen meshes in the half
meridian of the shell. From its surface arise numerous oblique irregular
staffs or broad and thin lamellæ, which branch quite irregularly, and by
communications of the branches form the thin outer shell. This is quite

surface arise in an extremely irregular and variable manner numerous
oblique spines, often curved, often lamellar, and perforated by pores,

{121}Family VII. #STYLOSPHÆRIDA#, Haeckel (Pls. 13-17).

_Stylosphærida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 449.

_Definition._--#Sphæroidea# with two radial spines on the surface of the
spherical shell, opposite in one axis; living solitary (not associated in
colonies).

The family #Stylosphærida# comprises a large number of very common
#Sphæroidea#, and is distinguished from all others by the possession of two
radial spines which are placed in one axis of the spherical shell.[67] By
the expression of this "main axis" as a solid rod they form the transition
to the #Prunoidea#, in which the whole shell is more or less transformed
according to this "monaxial growth." But in these latter the shell, as well
as the central capsule, becomes ellipsoidal, prolonged in one axis, whilst
in the former they remain spherical. However, the distinction of both
nearly allied groups is sometimes difficult.

The most simple Stylosphærida are the _Xiphostylida_, with one single
spherical lattice-shell. To this ancestral group all other subfamilies can
be opposed as "Stylosphærida concentrica," as their carapace is composed of
two or more concentric lattice-shells: two in the Sphærostylida, three in
the Amphistylida, four in the Cromyostylida, five or more in the
Caryostylida. In all these four subfamilies the concentric shells are
simple (not spongy) fenestrated spheres. In a sixth subfamily, in the
Spongostylida, the shell is wholly or partially composed of a spongy
irregular wicker-work, with or without a medullary shell in the centre.

Both the radial spines in all Stylosphærida are opposed normally in one
axis; but in many species besides the normal form occur individual
abnormalities, in which the two spines are not accurately opposed in this
main axis, but placed in two different axes, intersecting at a smaller or
larger angle. In the majority of the Stylosphærida both opposite spines
have the same size and form; but in some genera they are more or less
different, often in a very striking degree. The same differences occur in
the nearly allied groups of #Prunoidea#, in the Ellipsida and Druppulida.

The distal ends of both spines are commonly free; but in the small group of
Saturnalida (_Saturnalis_ with one single shell, _Saturnulus_ with two
concentric shells, _Saturninus_ with three concentric shells) the distal
ends of both spines are united, at equal distances from the centre, by a
circular or elliptical ring. This remarkable peculiarity occurs in no other
group of #Sphæroidea#, and consequently brings the Saturnalida into close
relation with the #Discoidea#.

cortical shell being double, the medullary shell simple; and perhaps these
forms may better represent a peculiar genus, _Amphisphæridium_.

Subfamily CARYOSTYLIDA, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, pp. 449, 454.

lattice-shells.



Genus 56. _Caryostylus_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 454.

_Definition._--#Stylosphærida# with five to six or more concentric
lattice-shells and two free opposite spines of equal size and similar form.

The genus _Caryostylus_ differs from its ancestral form, _Stylocromyum_, by
the multiplication of the concentric spheres, the number of which amounts
to five or six or more. I have only observed one single species of this
genus. Some similar forms which in my Prodromus (1881, p. 454) were annexed
to it, and disposed in three nearly allied genera (_Caryoxiphus_,
_Caryodoras_, _Caryolonche_), have now been proved to belong to other
groups, mainly ellipsoidal Druppulida.


1. _Caryostylus hexalepas_, n. sp.

Surface of the spherical shell smooth. Radial proportion of the component
six concentric shells = 1 : 2 : 7 : 9 : 12 : 15. Both medullary shells
connected only by six radial beams, opposite in pairs in the three
dimensive axes. Between second and third shell numerous (twenty regularly
disposed?) radial beams. Four cortical shells connected by very numerous
(sixty to eighty or more?) short radial beams. Pores of all six shells
regular, circular, the size increasing towards the surface, two to three
times as broad as the bars. Two opposite polar spines very large, of equal
size, three times as long as the shell radius, cylindrical, club-shaped at
the thicker distal end. (The whole shell structure is similar to Pl. 15,
fig. 2, but the shells are spherical, not ellipsoidal.)

{149}Genus 57. _Spongolonchis_,[79] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 455.

_Definition._--#Stylosphærida# with a solid sphere of spongy framework, and
with two opposite free radial spines.

The genus _Spongolonchis_ differs from its probable ancestral form,
_Styptosphæra_, by the development of two opposite radial spines situated
in one axis.


1. _Spongolonchis compacta_, n. sp.

Spongy framework of the spherical shell very compact, with small meshes,
three to four times as broad as the bars. Surface rough, but not spiny. Two
polar spines pyramidal, only as long as the radius of the shell, one-third
as broad at the base.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.2; length of the spines 0.1, basal
breadth 0.03.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 274, depth 2750 fathoms.


2. _Spongolonchis laxa_, n. sp.

Spongy framework loose, with large meshes, ten to twelve times as broad as
the bars. Surface spiny. Two polar spines three-sided prismatic, longer
than the diameter of the shell (broken off in the observed specimen).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.5; length of the spine 0.6 and more,
breadth 0.02.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 265, depth 2900 fathoms.



Genus 58. _Spongostylus_,[80] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 455.

_Definition._--#Stylosphærida# with spongy spherical cortical shell,
enclosing in the centre a simple latticed medullary shell, and with two
opposite free radial spines.

The genus _Spongostylus_ may probably be derived from _Spongoplegma_ by
development of two opposite radial spines in one axis.


1. _Spongostylus hastatus_, n. sp.

Spongy cortical shell with compact framework, twice as broad as the
enclosed medullary shell, the pores of which are regular, circular, twice
as broad as the bars. Two polar spines, three times as long as the radius
of the shell, in the basal two-thirds cylindrical, in the distal third
compressed, two-edged, spear-shaped.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the cortical shell 0.1, medullary shell 0.05;
length of the spines 0.15.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic, Station 335, depth 1425 fathoms.

  Berlin, p. 299, Taf. viii. fig. 14.

Spongy cortical shell with rather compact framework, four times as broad as
the enclosed medullary shell, the pores of which are irregular, roundish,
three to four times as broad as the bars. Two polar spines sword-shaped,
two-edged, as long as the shell diameter.

Sea, depth 3300 fathoms.


3. _Spongostylus serratus_, n. sp.

Spongy cortical shell with lax framework, ten to twelve times as broad as
the enclosed medullary shell, the pores of which are irregular, roundish,
once and a half to twice as broad as the bars. Two polar spines longer than
the shell diameter (broken off in the observed specimen), three-sided
prismatical, with three straight serrated edges.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the cortical shell 0.5, medullary shell 0.04;
length of the spines 0.6 or more.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 285, depth 2375 fathoms.



Genus 59. _Spongostylidium_,[81] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 455.

_Definition._--#Stylosphærida# with spongy spherical cortical shell,
enclosing two concentric spherical latticed medullary shells, and with two
opposite, free radial spines.

The genus _Spongostylidium_ differs from _Spongostylus_ by duplication of
the latticed medullary shell, and therefore bears the same relation to it
as _Spongodictyon_ to _Spongoplegma_.


1. _Spongostylidium streptacanthum_, n. sp.

Both medullary shells spherical, with small, regular, circular pores, twice
as broad as the bars (outer twice as broad as the inner). Spongy cortical
shell enclosing it with dense framework, four times as broad as the outer
medullary shell. Two polar spines very large, four times as long as the
diameter of the outer shell; as broad as the inner medullary shell, with
three dentated, spirally contorted edges. (Very similar to the common
_Spongosphæra streptacantha_ and to _Hexadoridium streptacanthum_, but with
only two opposite spines in one axis.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the cortical shell 0.16, of the outer medullary
shell 0.04, inner 0.02; length of the spines 0.7 and more, breadth 0.02.

_Habitat._--Indian Ocean, Cocos Islands, Rabbe.



{151}Family VIII. #STAUROSPHÆRIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 15).

_Staurosphærida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 449.

_Definition._--#Sphæroidea# with four radial spines on the surface of the
spherical shell, forming a regular cross, being opposite in pairs in two
axes perpendicular to one another; living solitary (not associated in
colonies).

The family #Staurosphærida# is distinguished from the other #Sphæroidea# by
the possession of four radial spines, which are opposite in pairs in two
perpendicularly crossed axes. By these "two main axes" an equatorial plane
is determined, which approximates them to the #Discoidea#. But in the
latter the shells as well as the central capsule become more or less
flattened, lenticular, or discoidal, whilst in the former they remain
spherical. However, some forms of both groups are very similar, and
inspection from different sides (and mainly from the margin of the
equatorial plane) is required to determine the spherical (not compressed)
shell-form of the Staurosphærida. As a rule the species of this family are
much rarer, and much less numerous, than those of all the other
#Sphæroidea#.

The most simple Staurosphærida are the Staurostylida, with one single
spherical lattice-shell. To this ancestral group all other subfamilies can
be opposed as "Staurosphærida concentrica," since their carapace is
composed of two or more concentric lattice-shells; two in the
Staurolonchida, three in the Stauracontida, four in the Staurocromyida,
five or more in the Staurocaryida. In all these four subfamilies the
concentric shells are simple (not spongy) fenestrated spheres. In a sixth
subfamily, in the Staurodorida, the shell is wholly or partially composed
of irregular spongy wickerwork, with or without a medullary shell in the
centre.

_The Four Radial Spines_ in all Staurosphærida are normally opposed in
pairs in two axes perpendicular one to another, and therefore together form
a rectangular cross. But in many species besides this normal form
individual abnormalities occur, in which the four spines in the equatorial
plane are not quite accurately opposed, so that the four angles between
them are not right angles, but more or less unequal. More rarely also their
position in the equatorial plane is not accurately retained, so that they
are placed in two, three, or four different meridian planes, intersecting
at very small variable angles.

In the greater part of Staurosphærida all four radial spines are quite
equal, and of the same size and form. But in some genera there takes place
a more or less considerable differentiation of the four spines, commonly in
pairs, so that the two opposite spines of each pair are equal, but the
pairs different (_Staurostylus_, _Staurolonchidium_). More rarely also both
spines of one pair become unequal, whilst those of the other pair remain
equal (_Stauroxiphos_). Very rarely all four spines assume a different size
or form.

Genus 60. _Staurosphæra_,[83] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 450.

_Definition._--#Staurosphærida# with a single lattice-sphere and four
crossed equal spines.

The genus _Staurosphæra_ may be regarded as the common ancestral form of
this subfamily, since it represents their most simple and primitive form.
From the surface of the simple lattice-sphere, enclosing the central
capsule, arise four equal, simple, radial spines, opposite in pairs in two
diameters, perpendicular one to another. _Staurosphæra_ may be derived
phylogenetically either from _Cenosphæra_ by production of the four spines,
or from _Hexastylus_ by reduction of two opposite spines.

_Definition._--#Staurosphærida# with five or more concentric
lattice-spheres and four crossed, equal spines.

The genus _Staurocaryum_ has arisen from the preceding _Staurocromyum_ by
the further multiplication of the concentric spheres; in the only observed
form there are six, at nearly equal distances apart.


1. _Staurocaryum arborescens_, n. sp. (Pl. 15, fig. 8).

Shell composed of six concentric latticed spheres, at nearly equal
distances apart, and with somewhat regular, circular pores, the size of
which gradually increases from the first to the sixth shell. The surface of
the outermost shell is densely covered with numerous arborescent by-spines,
which bifurcate from three to four times, and are three-sided pyramidal at
the base, and twice as long as the distance between each two shells. The
six shells are connected only by four crossed, conical, radial beams, which
increase in diameter from the centre, and are prolonged outside into very
stout cylindrical, radial spines, irregularly covered with small thorns and
forked ramules, and nearly as long as the shell diameter. Only a single
specimen was observed.

Family IX. #CUBOSPHÆRIDA#, Haeckel (Pls. 21-25).

_Cubosphærida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 449.

_Definition._--#Sphæroidea# with six radial spines on the surface of the
spherical shell, opposite in pairs in the three dimensive axes,
perpendicular one to another; living solitary (not associated in colonies).

The family #Cubosphærida# is distinguished from the other #Sphæroidea# by
the possession of six radial spines, which are opposite in pairs in three
different axes, one perpendicular to the other two. These three axes are
the typical "dimensive axes," which are more or less differentiated in the
#Larcoidea#. But in these latter the shell itself and the enclosed central
capsule become affected by the unequal growth in the three axes, whilst in
the former the capsule constantly, and commonly also the shell, remains
spherical. Sometimes the shell assumes the form of a regular octahedron,
from the six corners of which arise the six radial spines, indicating its
three axes.

The most simple Cubosphærida are the Hexastylida, with one single,
spherical lattice-shell. To this ancestral group all other subfamilies can
be opposed as "Cubosphærida concentrica," as their carapace is composed of
two or more concentric lattice-shells--two in the Hexalonchida, three in
the Hexacontida, four in the Hexacromyida, five or more in the Hexacaryida.
In all these four subfamilies the concentric shells are simple (not
spongy), fenestrated spheres. In a sixth subfamily, in the Hexadorida, the
shell is wholly or partially composed of irregular, spongy wicker-work or
loose reticulations, with or without a medullary shell in the centre.

The _Six Radial Spines_ of the Cubosphærida are normally opposite in pairs
in the three dimensive axes, each of which is perpendicular to the other
two. But in many species besides this normal form occur individual
abnormalities, in which the six spines are not quite accurately opposed,
but more or less divergent; and often also the three dimensive planes
(determined each by two axes) are not quite regular, but more or less
uneven. More rarely the six spines appear disposed in quite an irregular
manner.

In the greater part of the Cubosphærida all six spines are quite equal, of
the same size and form. But in some genera a more or less considerable
differentiation takes place, so {170}that two pairs or all three pairs of
spines become different; very rarely, also both spines of one pair become
unequal (probably only an individual abnormality). Those variations
correspond to the differences between the crystalline systems. The common
Cubosphærida, with three equal spine-pairs, correspond to the regular or
cubic system, with three equal axes. The rarer forms (_Hexastylarium_,
_Hexaloncharium_, _Hexacontarium_) exhibit two equal pairs and one
different pair; they correspond to the quadratic system, with three
perpendicular axes, two of which are equal, the third unequal. Still more
rare are those forms (_Hexastylidium_, _Hexalonchidium_), in which all
three pairs of spines are different, corresponding to the three unequal
axes of the rhombic crystalline system.

the surface of the simple spherical lattice-shell. These six simple spines
are of equal size and opposite in pairs in the three dimensive axes,
corresponding to the three equal axes of a cubic crystal.

Genus 73. _Hexastylarium_,[102] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Cubosphærida# with one simple lattice-sphere and six simple
spines of different sizes; one opposite pair larger than the other two.

The genus _Hexastylarium_ differs from its probable ancestral form,
_Hexastylus_, by the unequal growth of the six simple spines; two opposite
spines of one pair being more strongly developed than the four others,
which are equal. They correspond therefore to the three axes of a quadratic
crystal.


1. _Hexastylarium heteraxonium_, n. sp.

Cortical shell thin walled, smooth, with regular, hexagonal pores, three
times as broad as the bars; eight to ten on the radius. Six spines
three-sided pyramidal, at the base as broad as one pore. Two opposite major
spines longer than the shell diameter; four others scarcely as long as
{178}the radius. (Similar to _Hexastylus phænaxonius_, Pl. 21, fig. 3, but
differing in the unequal length of the spines.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.15, pores 0.12, bars 0.004; length
of the two major spines 0.2, of the four minor 0.07.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 265, depth 2900 fathoms.


2. _Hexastylarium quadratum_, n. sp.

Shell very delicate, with smooth surface, and irregular, polygonal pores,
separated by very thin bars. The form of the shell is not, as commonly, a
sphere, but a geometrical square octahedron, one axis (with two opposite
major spines) being nearly twice as long as the other two dimensive axes;
four spines, opposite by pairs in the latter, are only half as long. The
eight sides of the octahedral shell are even, equilateral-triangular.
Spines angular, thin.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell in the major axis 0.18, in the minor
0.1; length of the major spines 0.24, minor 0.12.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 295, depth 1500 fathoms.


3. _Hexastylarium elongatum_, n. sp.

two to four times as broad as the bars; eight to ten on the radius. Two
opposite major spines, three to four times as long as the shell diameter,
whilst the four other spines are very short, scarcely as long as the
radius. All six spines at the base three-sided pyramidal, the two longer
being cylindrical.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.1; length of the major spines 0.3 to
0.4, of the minor 0.04, basal breadth 0.02.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 244, surface.



Genus 74. _Hexastylidium_,[103] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 450.

_Definition._--#Cubosphærida# with one simple lattice-sphere and six simple
spines in pairs different; the two opposite spines of each pair equal, the
three pairs unequal.

The genus _Hexastylidium_ differs from its probable ancestral form,
_Hexastylus_, by the unequal growth of the six simple spines; the two
spines of each pair reaching the same dimensions, whilst the three pairs
are different. They correspond therefore to the three axes of a rhombic
crystal.


1. _Hexastylidium rhomboides_, n. sp.

Shell thin walled, smooth, with irregular, polygonal pores and very thin
bars. Its form is not, as commonly, a sphere, but a rhombic octahedron. The
radial proportion of the three unequal {179}dimensive axes = 1 : 2 : 4. The
radial proportion of the three pairs of spines = 1 : 3 : 8. Spines thin
cylindrical, at the base angular.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the major shell axis 0.2, middle 0.1, minor
0.05; length of the major spines 0.3, middle 0.12, minor 0.04.

three to five times as broad as the bars; six spines very stout, prismatic
(as broad as one large pore), with three ring-like, spirally convoluted
edges. Two opposite major spines of extraordinary length, ten to twelve
times as long as the shell diameter, the two middle opposite spines being
about as long as the latter, the two minor scarcely one-third as long.
(Similar to _Hexastylus spiralis_, Pl. 21, fig. 7, but distinguished by the
very unequal length of the spines.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.12; length of the major spines 1 to
1.5 mm., middle 0.15, minor 0.04.

Subfamily HEXALONCHIDA,[104] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, pp. 449, 451.

_Definition._--#Cubosphærida# with two concentric spherical lattice-shells.



Genus 75. _Hexalonche_,[105] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 451.

_Definition._--#Cubosphærida# with two concentric lattice-spheres and six
simple spines of equal size.

The genus _Hexalonche_ is the most simple form, and probably the common
ancestral form, of all Hexalonchida, or those Cubosphærida which possess
two concentric latticed spheres, connected by six radial beams. Commonly
one shell is intracapsular (medullary shell) and the other extracapsular
(cortical shell); but sometimes also both shells are extracapsular, and
these forms may perhaps be better separated as a peculiar genus
_Hexadilemma_. In _Hexalonche_ all six simple spines are of equal size, and
opposite by pairs in three equal dimensive axes, corresponding to the three
equal axes of a tesseral crystal. It can be derived from _Hexastylus_ by
duplication of the lattice-shell.



Subgenus 1. _Hexalonchara_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Pores of the cortical shell regular or subregular, of nearly
equal size and similar form; surface smooth, without radial by-spines

{180}1. _Hexalonche phænaxonia_, n. sp.

Cortical shell thin walled, smooth; its pores regular, hexagonal, six to
eight times as broad as the bars; eight to ten to twelve on the radius.
Medullary shell one-third as broad, with regular, hexagonal pores of half
size. Six spines triangular pyramidal, as long as the radius of the shell,
at the base as broad as one pore. (Differs from _Hexastylus phænaxonius_,
Pl. 21, fig. 3, only in the medullary shell and the six inner radial beams,
connecting it with the cortical shell.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the outer shell 0.15, pores 0.01 to 0.015, bars

Cortical shell thick walled, smooth, two and a half time as broad as the
medullary shell. Pores of the latter (fig. 3_a_) regular circular; eight to
ten on the half meridian, about as broad as the bars between them. Pores of
the outer shell regular, hexagonal, remarkable for a very peculiar form and
arrangement. In the transverse section of the shell (fig. 3_b_) they appear
as narrow, hexagonal prismatic canals, twice as high as broad, and four to
five times as broad as the thin elevated bars between them. Every seven
meshes form together a larger, regular hexagon (six pores surrounding one
central pore). The periphery of these larger, rosette-like hexagons
projects more strongly from the surface than the walls between the smaller
hexagons. On the half meridian of the shell may be counted six to seven
larger and eighteen to twenty smaller hexagons.  The six radial beams
between the two shells are thin, three-sided prismatic, not broader than
the bars of the network, the prominent prolongations of which form six very
strong spines of peculiar club-like shape (fig. 3), as long as the radius
of the outer shell. The three wings of the club are lower in the inner,
higher in the outer half; the broadest part of the spine (at the base and
in the outer third) is as broad as a hexagonal rosette (equal to three
meshes of the outer shell); its outer apex is pyramidal.

branches on each spine.



Subgenus 1. _Hexancora_, Haeckel.

Genus 77. _Hexaloncharium_,[107] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Cubosphærida# with two concentric lattice-spheres and six
simple spines of different sizes; one opposite pair larger than the two
others.

The genus _Hexaloncharium_ exhibits the same relation to its ancestral
form, _Hexalonche_, that _Hexastylarium_ bears to _Hexastylus_. Two
opposite spines of one pair are larger than the four others, and correspond
to the three axes of a quadratic crystal.


1. _Hexaloncharium octahedrum_, n. sp.

Cortical shell smooth, three to four times as broad as the spherical
medullary shell, each having regular circular pores, twice to three times
as broad as the bars. Form of the outer shell not a sphere, but a regular
octahedron, with eight congruent, equilateral triangular even faces. Two
opposite spines twice as long as the shell diameter, whilst the four others
are scarcely equal to it. Basal breadth of all six the same (three times as
large as one pore); form, three-sided prismatic, with cuspidate distal end.
(Similar to _Hexalonche octahedra_, Pl. 22, fig. 8, but distinct in the
unequal length of the spines.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the outer shell 0.16, inner 0.045; length of the

Cortical shell spherical, covered with short conical by-spines, twice as
broad as the medullary shell; both with regular circular pores three to
four times as broad as the bars. Two major spines cylindrical, with conical
apex, three times as long as the four others, which are conical and about
as long as the shell radius; basal breadth of all six the same (equal to
one pore). Similar to _Hexalonche anaximenis_ (Pl. 25, fig. 5), but
distinct in the enormous prolongation of two opposite spines.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the outer shell 0.12, inner 0.06; length of the
two major spines 0.2, of the four minor 0.06, basal breadth 0.02.

{191}3. _Hexaloncharium hystricinum_, n. sp.

Cortical shell spherical, three times as broad as the medullary shell, and
densely covered with oblique bristle-shaped by-spines. Pores irregular
roundish. Two opposite major spines three-sided prismatic, longer than the
shell diameter; four minor spines pyramidal, scarcely half as long as the
shell radius. (Somewhat similar to _Hexalonche hystricina_, but distinct in
the prolongation of two major spines.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the outer shell 0.15, inner 0.05; length of the
two major spines 0.2, four minor 0.03, basal breadth 0.02.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 288, surface.



Genus 78. _Hexalonchidium_,[108] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 451.

_Definition._--#Cubosphærida# with two concentric lattice-spheres and six
simple spines of different sizes in pairs; the two opposite spines of each
pair equal, the three pairs unequal.

The genus _Hexalonchidium_ exhibits the same relation to _Hexalonche_ that
_Hexastylidium_ bears to _Hexastylus_; the growth of the three spine-pairs
is different, whilst both spines of each pair are equal; they correspond
therefore to the three axes of a rhombic crystal.


1. _Hexalonchidium axonometrum_, n. sp.

Cortical shell thin walled, covered with short bristle-shaped by-spines,
twice as broad as the medullary shell; both with regular hexagonal meshes,
twice to three times as broad as the bars (inner meshes half as broad as
the outer). All three spine-pairs three-sided prismatic, of very different
length but of equal breadth (equal to three pores). Major spine-pair twice
as long as the shell diameter; middle pair about equal to the latter, minor
scarcely half as long. (Similar to _Hexalonche anaximandri_, Pl. 22, fig.
5, but distinct in the different length of the spines.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the outer shell 0.12, inner 0.06; length of the
major spines 0.25, middle 0.1, minor 0.04.

_Definition._--Shell with three concentric lattice-spheres and six simple
spines of equal size.

The genus _Hexacontium_, the ancestral form of the Hexacontida, is probably
derived from _Hexalonche_ by duplication of the medullary shell. As in the
latter, all six spines are of equal size, opposite in pairs in the three
dimensive axes, and correspond therefore to the three equal axes of a
tesseral crystal.



Subgenus 1. _Hexacontanna_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Pores of the cortical shell regular or subregular, of nearly
equal size and similar form; surface smooth, without radial spines or
papillæ (other than the six main spines).

more.

The genus _Hexadendron_ differs from _Hexacontium_ in the ramification of
the six dimensive spines, and from the similar _Hexancistra_ in the
duplication of the medullary shell. As in the latter instance, each spine
can bear either three simple lateral branches or three rows of pinnate
lateral branches.

main spines very large, three-sided prismatic, with three rows of pinnate,
lateral branches, on the three wing-like, spirally twisted edges (similar

_Definition._--#Cubosphærida# with three concentric lattice-spheres and six

others.

The genus _Hexacontarium_ exhibits to its ancestral form _Hexacontium_ the
same relation that _Hexaloncharium_ bears to _Hexalonche_; the former is
developed from the latter by duplication of the medullary shell. As two
opposite spines of one pair are larger than the four others, they
correspond to the three axes of a quadratic crystal.

spines longer than the shell diameter; four other minor spines only half as
long as the radius. (Similar to _Hexacontium clavigerum_, Pl. 23, fig. 5,
but distinct by the prolongation of the spines of one axis.)

branches forming the delicate fourth shell. Surface smooth. Radial spines
three-sided pyramidal, as long as the radius, as broad at the base as the

The genus _Cubosphæra_ is developed from the preceding _Hexacromyum_ by
further addition of the concentric lattice-shells, their number amounting
to five, six, or more. The innermost two of these are medullary shells, the
others being cortical shells. All are connected by six radial beams,
prolonged outside into six simple spines of equal size; these lie opposite
in pairs in three dimensive axes, corresponding to the three axes of a
cube.

Shell composed of five concentric spheres, with the radial proportion =
1 : 3 : 8 : 10 : 13. The two medullary shells with small regular, circular
pores of the same breadth as the bars. Inner cortical shell (third shell)
with large regular, circular pores, four times as broad as the bars,
hexagonally framed. From each hexagon-corner arises a thin bristle-shaped
radial by-spine, which at a fixed distance from the centre is united with
the middle cortical shell (fourth shell), which has very small circular
pores. The beginning of the fifth shell (outermost) is indicated by six
small reticula, produced by the six main spines at equal distances from the

pores, twice as broad as the bars. The four cortical shells of the same
structure, with irregular, roundish pores, three to four times as broad as
the bars. The size of these pores and the breadth of their bars gradually
increase towards the smooth surface. All six shells are connected by six
thin three-sided prismatic radial beams, which are prolonged outside in six
stronger spines, angular pyramidal, with smooth edges, as long as the shell
radius.

The genus _Hexacaryum_ is distinguished from the foregoing _Cubosphæra_ by
ramification of the six radial spines, and therefore exhibits the same
relation to it that _Hexancistra_ bears to _Hexastylus_, &c.


1. _Hexacaryum arborescens_, n. sp. (Pl. 23, figs. 4, 4_a_).

Shell composed of five, six, or more concentric shells, which are united by
six very large radial spines. The two medullary shells spherical, inner
with regular, circular, outer with irregular polygonal pores. All cortical
shells (third and following) not spherical, but regular octahedral, with
irregular polygonal meshes and thin bars. Radial spines prismatic, with
three wing-like, spirally twisted edges, which at equal distances send out
thin forked lateral branches (six on each {204}verticil); by further
ramification and communication of these branches the triangular net-plates
arise, filling out the sides of the octahedral cortical shells. Diameter of
all shells little different. The outer free parts of the six spines are
arborescent, twice to three times as long as the enclosed inner parts, and
bear six to eight verticils of free lateral branches, decreasing in size

Subfamily HEXADORIDA,[118] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, pp. 449, 455.

_Definition._--#Cubosphærida# with spongy spherical or octahedral shell
(with or without enclosed concentrical lattice-shells).



Genus 85. _Cubaxonium_,[119] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Cubosphærida# with solid spongy spherical or octahedral
shell, without latticed medullary shell in the centre, and with six simple
radial spines of equal size.

The genus _Cubosphæra_ may be regarded as a form of _Styptosphæra_, which
develops six radial spines, opposite in pairs in the three dimensive axes.
The solid spongy framework of the shell assumes the outer form either of a
sphere, or of a regular octahedron.


1. _Cubaxonium spongiosum_, n. sp.

Spongy shell spherical, composed of a very dense spongy framework of nearly
uniform structure; the meshes three to four times as broad as the bars;
surface almost smooth. Six spines cylindrical, twice to three times as long
as the diameter of the spongy sphere, about as broad as one half mesh.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the sphere 0.2, meshes 0.006 to 0.008, bars
0.002; length of the spines 0.4 to 0.5, breadth 0.004.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 288, surface.


2. _Cubaxonium octahedrum_, n. sp.

Spongy shell octahedral, composed of a loose spongy framework of nearly
uniform structure; the meshes ten to twelve times as broad as the bars;
surface thorny. Six spines three-sided {205}pyramidal, longer than the
diameter of the octahedron, arising from its six corners, as broad at the
base as one mesh.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.15, meshes 0.01 to 0.012, bars
0.001; length of the spines 0.2, basal breadth 0.01.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 300, surface.



Genus 86. _Hexadoras_,[120] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 455.

_Definition._--#Cubosphærida# with spongy spherical shell and one simple
latticed medullary shell in its centre, having six simple spines of equal
size.

The genus _Hexadoras_ exhibits the same structure of the spongy shell as
_Spongoplegma_, but differs from it in the production of six dimensive
spines. In the centre lies one simple, latticed, medullary shell, which is
either spherical or octahedral. In the latter case the six spines arise
from the six corners of the octahedron.


1. _Hexadoras axophæna_, n. sp.

Medullary shell spherical, with regular hexagonal meshes, twice as broad as
the bars. Cortical shell entirely enclosing it, with loose irregular
framework and thorny surface. Diameter of the outer shell three times as
large as that of the inner. Six radial spines arising from the medullary
shell, four to five times as long as the radius of the cortical shell,
three-sided prismatic, with straight dentated edges.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the outer shell 0.15, inner 0.05; length of the
spines 0.3 to 0.4.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 265, depth 2900 fathoms.


2. _Hexadoras lychnosphæra_, n. sp.

Medullary shell spherical, with regular, circular, hexagonally framed
pores, three times as broad as the bars. Cortical shell enveloping it, with
loose irregular framework and spiny surface. Diameter of the outer shell
eight times as large as that of the inner. Six radial spines arising from
the inner shell, three-sided prismatic, with dentated, spirally contorted
edges, seven times as long as the diameter of the medullary shell, with
three lateral branches at the distal end (similar to _Lychnosphæra_, Pl.
11, fig. 1).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the outer shell 0.5, inner 0.06; total length of
the spines 0.4, breadth 0.01.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 270, depth 2925 fathoms.


3. _Hexadoras octahedrum_, n. sp.

Medullary shell regular octahedral, with irregular polygonal meshes, five
times as broad as the bars. Cortical shell enveloping it, with dense spongy
framework, also octahedral with rough surface. {206}Diameter of the outer
shell five times as large as that of the inner. Six radial spines very
long, arising from the six corners of the inner and piercing the spongy
mass of the outer shell, considerably exceeding it at the free distal end,
three-sided prismatic, with elegantly denticulate edges.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the outer shell 0.2, inner 0.04; total length of
the spines 0.3 or more, breadth 0.02.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 266, depth 2750 fathoms.



Genus 87. _Hexadoridium_,[121] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 455.

_Definition_.--#Cubosphærida# with spongy spherical shell and two
concentric latticed medullary shells in its centre, having six simple
spines of equal size.


The genus _Hexadoridium_ differs from _Hexadoras_ in the duplication of the
medullary shell, and exhibits therefore the same relation to it that
_Spongodictyon_ bears to _Spongoplegma_. In the only known species the six
spines are opposite, arranged quite regularly in pairs in the three
dimensive axes, and consequently represent the three axes of a regular
crystal or cube.


1. _Hexadoridium streptacanthum_, n. sp. (Pl. 25, figs. 1, 1_a_).

Both medullary shells spherical, with small regular, circular pores, twice
as broad as the bars; outer twice as broad as the inner. Spongy cortical
shell enclosing it with dense framework, five times as broad as the outer
medullary shell, regular octahedral. Six radial spines, arising from the
latter, are thinned at the inner end, three to five times as long as the
diameter of the cortical shell, and nearly as broad as the inner medullary
shell, with three dentated and spirally contorted edges. (Very similar to
the common _Spongosphæra streptacantha_, with irregular and variable number
and dispositions of spines; possibly its ancestral form?).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the cortical shell 0.2, of the outer medullary
shell 0.04, inner 0.02; length of the spines 1 mm. and more, breadth 0.02.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.



Family X. #ASTROSPHÆRIDA# (Pls. 11, 18-20, 26-30).

_Astrosphærida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 449.

_Definition._--#Sphæroidea# with numerous (eight to twelve or more,
commonly between twenty and sixty) radial spines on the surface of the
spherical shell; living solitary (not associated in colonies).

The family #Astrosphærida#, the largest and most varied of all
#Sphæroidea#, is distinguished from the other members of this group by the
possession of numerous {207}radial spines, which are either regularly or
irregularly disposed on the surface of the spherical shell. The extreme
variability and richness of form in this family is mainly due to the
different size, shape, and disposition of these radial spines.

The simplest Astrosphærida are the Coscinommida, with a single spherical or
polyhedral lattice-shell. To this ancestral group all other subfamilies can
be opposed as "Astrosphærida composita," since their skeleton is composed
of two or more concentric lattice-shells: two in the Haliommida, three in
the Actinommida, four in the Cromyommida, five or more in the Caryommida.
In these four subfamilies the concentric shells are all simple (not spongy)
fenestrated spheres or endospherical polyhedra. In the sixth subfamily, the
Spongiommida, the shell is wholly or partially composed of spongy irregular
wicker-work, with or without a medullary shell in the centre.

_The Number of the Radial Spines_ in the Astrosphærida is extremely
variable, and ranges from eight to forty or more; in many cases more than
one hundred. Often each nodal-point of the network develops on the shell
surface one spine. Still more frequently the number of the spines is less
than that of the nodal-points. In all concentric Astrosphærida, having two
or more concentrical shells, we can distinguish "primary spines," as outer
prolongations of the inner radial beams connecting the shells, and
"secondary spines," developed only on the outer surface of the shell.
Naturally the former are of much greater importance than the latter. But we
can also often distinguish among the latter larger "main spines" and
smaller "by-spines," the latter commonly much more numerous than the
former.

_The Disposition of the Radial Spines_, either regular or irregular, is a
subject of great morphological interest, and remains to be exhausted by
further observations. The following cases of regular disposition have been
observed by me--(A) eight spines, opposite in pairs in four axes
corresponding to the four diagonal axes of a cube; (B) nine spines,
regularly disposed at equal distances (?) (not opposed in pairs); (C) ten
spines, disposed at equal distances (?); (D) twelve spines, regularly
disposed, corresponding to the twelve corners of the regular icosahedron;
(E) fourteen spines, quite regularly disposed (six corresponding to the
three axes of a regular octahedron, eight to the central points of its
eight faces); (F) sixteen spines, regularly disposed (?); (G) twenty spines
(very common!), either disposed in the same manner (after the law of
Johannes Müller) as in the ACANTHARIA (?), or corresponding to the twenty
corners of the regular or pentagonal dodecahedron, or disposed in the same
manner as in many #Larcoidea# (Tholonida, &c., to be described afterwards);
(H) twenty-four spines, regularly disposed (?); (I) thirty-two spines,
quite regularly disposed (twenty corresponding to the twenty corners of the
regular dodecahedron, twelve to the central points of its twelve faces);
(K) forty spines, nearly regularly (or quite symmetrically?) disposed. If
the number of the spines amounts to more than forty, it is as a rule
impossible to determine their regular disposition in a satisfactory manner.

Genus 97. _Leptosphæra_,[132] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Astrosphærida# with two extracapsular cortical shells
without by-spines, connected by long prismatic radial spines.

The genus _Leptosphæra_, together with the three following genera, forms
the very peculiar and typical small group of #Sphæroidea# which we call the
Diplosphærida (with four genera and twenty-four species); their shell is
composed of two concentric spheres as in the three foregoing genera; but
whilst in these the inner shell is an intracapsular medullary shell and the
outer an extracapsular cortical shell, in the Diplosphærida {244}both
shells are extracapsular or cortical shells, therefore the inner shell of
the latter corresponds to the outer of the former. The inner spherical
shell of all Diplosphærida is composed of very delicate beams and large
pores, which are either regular hexagonal or irregular polygonal (never
roundish). From its surface arise a variable number (twenty to thirty) of
stout long radial spines, which are invariably longer than the shell
diameter (often two to three times as long or more), and of three-sided
prismatic form, the three edges either smooth or serrate, often with three
rows of lateral branches (commonly three to five branches in each row); the
latter are invariably of the same form, concavely curved towards the spine,
and decrease in size towards the distal end. From the three edges of each
main spine in all Diplosphærida, at equal distances from the centre, arise
six very thin, thread-like lateral branches (a pair from each edge) and
connect the spine in a tangential direction with all neighbouring spines.
In this manner the polyhedral outer shell is formed, the meshes of which
therefore are always very large and triangular. Sometimes each of these
primary triangular meshes becomes filled up with a secondary network,
either of regular quadrangular or of irregular polygonal secondary meshes.
Besides the constant twenty to thirty large main spines, in the majority of
Diplosphærida bristle-shaped radial by-spines arise, either from the inner
shell (_Diplosphæra_) or from the outer (_Drymosphæra_), or from both
(_Astrosphæra_). They are absent only in _Leptosphæra_. Commonly the
by-spines are simple, rarely forked or branched. The central capsule in the
Diplosphærida is usually enclosed in the inner shell; often it completely
fills up the latter, or drives out a cæcal protuberance through each mesh;
but these processes rarely unite outside. The average size of the
Diplosphærida, which are all pelagic organisms, is much larger than that of
the other Haliommida.

Genus 101. _Actinomma_,[137] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 440.

_Definition._--#Astrosphærida# with three concentric lattice-spheres and
numerous simple radial spines of one kind.

The genus _Actinomma_ is here restricted to those #Sphæroidea# which
combine the possession of three concentric lattice-shells with numerous
radial spines on the surface; the spines are all simple, being of one and
the same kind. Commonly two of the three shells are intracapsular medullary
shells, connected by radial beams (piercing {252}the central capsule) with
the outer, extracapsular, cortical shell. But in some species only one
medullary shell is enclosed in the central capsule, whilst both other
shells lie outside it. In such case the distance between these two cortical
shells is much smaller than their distance from the simple internal
medullary shell. These forms correspond more to aculeate _Rhodosphæræ_,
whilst the others resemble aculeate _Thecosphæræ_.

The genus _Pityomma_ differs from its ancestral form, _Actinomma_, in the

outside into twenty large three-sided prismatic spines. These are longer
than the shell diameter and have three dentate edges, being branched like a

The genus _Cromyomma_ is the common ancestral form of the Cromyommida, or
of those Astrosphærida in which the shell is composed of four concentric
spheres, connected by radial beams. Usually two of these are intracapsular
or medullary {261}shells, two extracapsular or cortical shells; the
distance between the former and the latter is greater than the distance
between either the two inner or the two outer shells. In some cases,
however (_e.g._, _Cromyomma zonaster_), the distance between all four
shells is equal.

more outer (extracapsular) cortical shells, composed of ordinary
lattice-work; distance between the former and the latter greater than
between any other two shells.

The genus _Caryomma_ may be regarded as a _Cromyomma_, in which the number
of the cortical shells is increased to three, four, or more. These lie
outside the central capsule, whilst two medullary shells lie within it, and
are connected with the former by numerous radial spines piercing the wall
of the capsule. The ordinary lattice-work is not arachnoidal, as in the
three following genera.


1. _Caryomma regulare_, n. sp.

Radial proportion of the five shells = 1 : 2 : 6 : 8 : 10. All five shells

Genus 108. _Arachnopila_,[146] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Astrosphærida# with five to ten or more cortical,
concentric, polyhedral, or spherical lattice-shells, composed of a very
thin cobweb-like network; innermost shell with hexagonal (regular) or
polygonal (irregular) meshes; other shells with simple triangular meshes,
without diagonal threads between them.

The genus _Arachnopila_, together with the two following genera, forms the
peculiar small group of large Arachnosphærida, separated from the true
Caryommida by the totally different structure and disposition of the
numerous concentric shells; the former exhibits a similar relation to the
latter that the Diplosphærida bears to the Elatommida among the dispherical
Haliommida. The concentric shells (five to ten or more) lie outside the
central capsule, and are composed of very delicate, cobweb-like threads.
From the innermost shell arise numerous, three-sided prismatic, very long
spines, from which at equal regular distances arise lateral branches (three
pairs from each spine, and one pair from each corner). In _Arachnopila_
these threads pass directly from one spine to the other, and form simple,
large, triangular meshes between them. The concentric shells are not
connected by interwoven diagonal threads.


1. _Arachnopila hexagonella_, n. sp.

Innermost shell with regular hexagonal pores; its diameter twice as long as
the equal distance between every two concentric shells. Radial spines
twenty to forty, each with twenty to twenty-four verticils.

concentric shells 0.05.

sixty to eighty, each with twelve to sixteen verticils.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the innermost shell 0.04; distance between the
concentric shells 0.04.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 266, surface.



{267}Genus 109. _Arachnopegma_,[147] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 454.

_Definition._--#Astrosphærida# with five to ten or more cortical,
concentric, polyhedral, or spherical lattice-shells, composed of a very
thin, cobweb-like network; innermost shell with hexagonal or polygonal
meshes; other shells with simple triangular meshes, connected to one
another by diagonal threads between them.

The genus _Arachnopegma_ differs from its ancestral form _Arachnopila_, in
the possession of peculiar diagonal threads, which connect the verticils or
nodal-points of every two neighbouring radial spines in two different
neighbouring concentric shells. In this case, therefore, not only do
triangular meshes lie in the spherical faces of the concentric spheres, but
also between them, in numerous oblique diagonal planes; a very rare and
remarkable structure, and forming a transition to spongy shells.


1. _Arachnopegma verticillatum_, n. sp.

Innermost shell with regular, hexagonal meshes; its diameter is the same as
the equal distance between each of the two shells. Threads of the network

{268}Genus 110. _Arachnosphæra_,[148] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p.
355.

_Definition._--#Astrosphærida# with five to ten or more cortical,
concentric, polyhedral, or spherical lattice-shells, composed of a very
thin cobweb-like network; innermost shell with hexagonal (regular) or
polygonal (irregular) meshes; other shells with larger, irregular,
polygonal meshes.

The genus _Arachnosphæra_ (accurately described by me in 1862, _loc. cit._)
differs from the two preceding genera in the irregular form of the large
meshes in all shells (except often the innermost). This is caused by the
ramification of the thin threads, which on each shell connect the
neighbouring spines. In _Arachnopila_ and _Arachnopegma_ the threads pass
directly and undivided from each spine to the neighbouring spine (three
pairs from the three edges), and therefore all meshes are triangular. In
_Arachnosphæra_ they become polygonal by irregular ramification of the
threads. There are here no diagonal threads.

than in the peripheral part. On the surface are sixty to eighty stout,
club-shaped radial spines, as long as the radius of the sphere, in the

_Definition._--#Astrosphærida# with solid spongy sphere, without latticed
medullary shell, with numerous branched radial spines.

The genus _Spongodrymus_ differs from the preceding _Spongiomma_ in the
ramification of the numerous radial spines, covering the surface of the
solid spongy sphere.


1. _Spongodrymus elaphococcus_, n. sp. (Pl. 18, fig. 9).

Spongy framework of the solid sphere equal throughout, on the surface
arising in the form of very numerous (sixty to eighty or more) spongy cones
with rather rhomboidal meshes. Each cone is prolonged into a very thin,
irregularly curved radial spine, which is twice as long as the shell
diameter, simple in the proximal half, branched like a tree in the distal
half; each arborescent spine has from sixteen to thirty-two terminal
branches, which fall in one spherical face. The branches of neighbouring
spines are partly connected by anastomoses, so that they begin to form an
outer spherical shell (cortical shell) with a looser spongy framework.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the whole spherical skeleton (sphere formed by
the distal ends of the dichotomous branches) 0.9, of the inner solid spongy
sphere 0.02.

_Habitat._--Tropical Atlantic, Station 349, surface.


2. _Spongodrymus abietinus_, n. sp.

Spongy framework denser and darker in the central part of the sphere than
in the peripheral part, with rather coarse meshes and thick bars. From the
surface arise very numerous (sixty to eighty) stout, radial branches, as
long as the shell radius, branched like a pine tree (with six to twelve

sphere.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the sphere 0.3; length of the spines 0.015.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 272, surface.



{273}Genus 113. _Spongechinus_,[152] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 456.

_Definition._--#Astrosphærida# with hollow, spongy sphere, without latticed
medullary shell in the central cavity, and with numerous simple radial
spines.

The genus _Spongechinus_ differs from its ancestral form, _Plegmosphæra_,
in the development of numerous radial spines on the surface of the spongy
sphere, within which is enclosed a large spherical central cavity.


1. _Spongechinus setosus_, n. sp.

Spongy sphere three times as broad as its inner cavity, with a very
delicate, equal framework. Entire surface covered with short, straight,
bristle-shaped radial spines, about half as long as the radius.

of the spines 0.05.

_Habitat._--North Atlantic, Azores, surface.


2. _Spongechinus serrulatus_, n. sp.

Spongy sphere twice as broad as its inner cavity, with a delicate, equal
framework. Entire surface covered with short, curved, radial spines, which
are elegantly denticulated, and as long as the shell radius.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the sphere 0.3, of its cavity 0.15; length of
the spines 0.15.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 274, surface.


3. _Spongechinus cavus_, n. sp.

Spongy sphere only one-fourth broader than the large inner cavity, its
spongy wall being only one-fourth as thick as the radius, composed of three
to four strata of irregular, small meshes. Surface covered with short,
bristle-shaped, curved spines, one-third as long as the radius.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the sphere 0.5, of its inner cavity 0.4; length
of the spines 0.08.

_Habitat._--North Atlantic, Station 354, surface.



Genus 114. _Spongothamnus_,[153] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Astrosphærida# with hollow, spongy sphere, without latticed
medullary shell in the central cavity, and with numerous branched radial
spines.

The genus _Spongothamnus_ differs from the preceding _Spongechinus_ in the
ramification of the numerous radial spines, covering the surface of the
hollow spongy sphere; {274}it therefore exhibits the same relation to the
latter that _Spongodrymus_ bears to _Spongiomma._


1. _Spongothamnus furcatus_, n. sp.

Spongy sphere twice as broad as its inner cavity, with very delicate bars,
and irregular, dense framework. From the surface arise one hundred and
fifty to one hundred and eighty thin, forked, bristle-shaped spines, half
as long as the radius; both fork branches one-third as long as the basal or
simple part.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the sphere 0.3, of its inner cavity 0.15; length
of the spines 0.08.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 241, surface.


2. _Spongothamnus scoparius_, n. sp.

Spongy sphere four times as broad as its inner cavity, with thick bars and
rather loose framework. From the surface arise sixty to eighty broom-shaped
radial spines, as long as the radius, each in the basal half simple, in the
distal half with six to twelve irregularly ramified branches (similar to
the spines of _Cromyodrymus abietinus_, Pl. 30, fig. 6).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the sphere 0.4, of the inner cavity 0.1; length
of the spines 0.2.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.



Genus 115. _Spongopila_,[154] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 456.

_Definition._--#Astrosphærida# with a single, spherical, latticed medullary
shell, immediately enveloped by the spongy framework of the cortical shell;
on the surface of the latter are numerous radial spines.

The genus _Spongopila_ is a _Spongoplegma_ with radial spines. On the other
hand it may be derived either from _Elaphococcus_, by communication of the
branched spines, or from _Arachnosphæra_, by development of spongy branches
between the concentric spheres.


1. _Spongopila dichotoma_, n. sp.

Medullary shell with regular, hexagonal meshes, six times as broad as the
bars. From each nodal-point (between every three meshes) arises a
bristle-shaped radial spine, which is dichotomously branched. By
communication of the neighbouring branches the loose spongy framework of
the spherical cortical shell is formed, which is four times as broad as the
medullary shell. On the surface occur very numerous bristle-shaped radial
spines, as long as the diameter of the medullary shell. (May be derived
from _Elaphococcus_.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy cortical shell 0.3, of the medullary
shell 0.08.

_Habitat._--Tropical Atlantic, Station 347, surface.


{275}2. _Spongopila verticillata_, n. sp.

Medullary shell with regular, hexagonal meshes, four times as broad as the
bars. From its surface arise forty to sixty, three-sided prismatic radial
spines, bearing eight to ten verticils of lateral branches, each verticil
with six forked branches (two from each edge). By irregular ramification of
these branches, and communication in all directions, the loose spongy
framework of the cortical shell originates, which is six times as broad as
the medullary shell. The free distal ends of the spines are as long as the
shell radius. (May be derived from _Arachnosphæra_.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy cortical shell 0.6, of the medullary
shell 0.1.

_Habitat._--Tropical Pacific, Station 200, surface.



Genus 116. _Rhizoplegma_,[155] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 456.

_Definition._--#Astrosphærida# with a single, spherical, latticed medullary
shell, which is not armed with by-spines, but connected by stout radial
main spines with the spongy cortical shell.

The genus _Rhizoplegma_ is immediately allied to the foregoing
_Spongopila_, but differs from it in the large interval separating both
shells.  In this interval lies the wall of the central capsule, which is
only pierced by the radial spines connecting both shells.



Subgenus 1. _Rhizoplegmarium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--No free lateral branches of the radial spines between the
two shells.


1. _Rhizoplegma polyacanthum_, n. sp.

Spongy cortical shell with a very fine dense framework and nearly smooth
surface (without superficial by-spines).  Its inner cavity is four times as
broad as the medullary shell, which exhibits regular, hexagonal meshes.
Radial spines sixty to eighty, three-sided prismatic, with three smooth
edges, without lateral branches between both shells; their free outer part
as long as the shell radius.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy cortical shell 0.3, of its inner
cavity 0.2, of the medullary shell 0.05.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 274, surface.


2. _Rhizoplegma spirale_, n. sp.

Spongy cortical shell with a very delicate loose framework and bristly
surface.  Its inner cavity three times as broad as the medullary shell,
which exhibits regular, hexagonal meshes. {276}Radial spines thirty to
forty, prismatic, with three smooth, spirally contorted edges, without
lateral branches between the two shells; their free outer part half as long
as the shell radius.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy cortical shell 0.2, of its inner
cavity 0.12, of the medullary shell 0.04.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 265, surface.


3. _Rhizoplegma trigonacantha_, n. sp.

Spongy cortical shell with a rather loose framework and coarse bars, with
nearly smooth surface (without by-spines). Its inner cavity twice as broad
as the medullary shell, which exhibits irregular, roundish pores. Radial
spines forty to sixty, prismatic, with three smooth straight edges, without
free branches between the two shells; their outer pyramidal part only
one-third of the shell radius. (Very similar to the common _Rhizosphæra
trigonacantha_, but with simple medullary shell.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy shell 0.2, of its inner cavity 0.16,
of the medullary shell 0.08.

_Habitat._--North Atlantic, Station 353, surface.



Subgenus 2. _Rhizoplegmidium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Between the two shells free lateral branches arise from the
three edges of the radial spines.


4. _Rhizoplegma radicatum_, n. sp. (Pl. 15, figs. 9, 9_a_).

Spongy cortical shell with a very loose framework; on the surface are
innumerable thin, forked, or repeatedly dichotomous by-spines. Its inner
cavity three times as broad as the medullary shell, which exhibits regular,
hexagonal meshes (fig. 9_a_). Radial spines twelve, prismatic, with
straight dentated edges, their outer pointed part as long as the shell
radius. Each spine between the two shells has a verticil of three forked
lateral branches (fig. 9_a_). The central capsule completely distends the
medullary shell, and forces out through each mesh a hernia-shaped process
(fig. 9).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy shell 0.5, of its inner cavity 0.25,
of the medullary shell 0.08.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.


5. _Rhizoplegma lychnosphæra_, n. sp. (Pl. 11, fig. 5).

  _Lychnosphæra rhizoplegma_, Haeckel, 1879, Atlas (pl. xi. fig. 5).

Spongy cortical shell with a very loose framework, composed of long thin
beams as in _Lychnosphæra regina_ (Pl. 11, figs. 1-4). Surface covered with
short bristles. Its inner cavity six times as broad as the medullary shell,
which exhibits regular, hexagonal meshes. Radial spines twelve, prismatic,
with three smooth edges; their outer pointed part half as long as the shell
radius. Each spine has three verticils of three forked branches; the first
verticil is free {277}between the two shells, while the two following
verticils, by communication of their ramules, form the irregular framework.
Central capsule with many herniæ, forced out through the meshes of the
medullary shell (fig. 5).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy shell 0.7, of its inner cavity 0.45,
of the medullary shell 0.07.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 284, surface.



Genus 117. _Lychnosphæra_,[156] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 453.

_Definition._--#Astrosphærida# with a single, spherical, latticed medullary
shell, which is armed with free radial by-spines, and connected by stout
radial main spines with the spongy cortical shell.

The genus _Lychnosphæra_, known only by one single, large, and very
remarkable species, mainly differs from the foregoing in the development of
free radial by-spines on the surface of the medullary shell, and in the
free interval between it and the cortical shell; but beyond this the loose
spongy framework of the latter exhibits a very remarkable structure,
figured in Pl. 11.


1. _Lychnosphæra regina_ (Pl. 11, figs. 1-4).

Medullary shell (fig. 3) with regular, circular, hexagonally framed pores,
twice as broad as the bars; from each hexagon-corner arises a radial,
bristle-shaped by-spine, as long as the diameter. Twelve radial main spines
each as broad as one of the meshes, three-sided prismatic, six to eight
times as long as the medullary shell. From their three leaf-shaped (often
somewhat denticulated or spirally contorted) edges arise four verticils of
lateral branches, each composed of three forked, thin branches. The forked
branches of the first verticil end free between the two shells (figs. 2,
3), while the two following verticils are ramified, and, by anastomosis of
their branches, compose the loose spongy framework of the cortical shell.
On the surface of the latter arise numerous radial (zig-zag-shaped)
by-spines. The fourth verticil is terminal, with three shorter, thicker,
dentated, simple branches, which constitute, together with the distal apex
of the spine itself, a bunch of four terminal spines. The large central
capsule completely distends the medullary shell, and forces out by its
pores numerous club-shaped herniæ (fig. 1).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy cortical shell 0.6, of its inner
cavity 0.4, of the central capsule 0.22, of the medullary shell 0.06;
length of the radial spines 0.4, breadth 0.01.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.



Genus 118. _Centrocubus_,[157] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Astrosphærida# with a single, cubical medullary shell,
immediately surrounded by the spongy framework of the cortical shell; from
the eight corners {278}of the central cube arise eight primary radial
spines, and often others from the framework between them.

The genus _Centrocubus_ and the following closely allied _Octodendron_ may
represent a peculiar small group of Spongiommida, remarkable for the
regular, cubical form of the medullary shell, which is composed of twelve
thin rods, corresponding to the twelve edges of a mathematical cube; from
the eight corners invariably arise eight primary radial spines, the
branches of which form the spongy cortical shell.


1. _Centrocubus octostylus_, n. sp.

Radial spines eight, arising from the eight corners of the cubiform,
regular, medullary shell, gradually increasing in thickness towards the
club-shaped distal end, which is five to six times as broad as the central
end. From the three denticulate edges of each spine arise six to eight
lateral branches, which ramify irregularly and form by their anastomosis
the spongy framework which is of nearly similar structure throughout, and
with large loose meshes. The free distal part of each spine is half as long
as the enclosed part.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the sphere 0.6, of the central cube 0.02; length
of the spines 0.15, distal thickness 0.02.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.


2. _Centrocubus cladostylus_, n. sp. (Pl. 18, fig. 1).

Radial spines thirty-two, club-shaped, at the distal end eight to ten times
as broad as at the basal end. Eight primary spines arise from the eight
corners of the regular, cubiform medullary shell, and from these, in the
form of lateral branches, twenty-four secondary spines arise with concavely
curved bases (three from the three denticulate edges of each spine, at
nearly equal distances from the centre). The free distal end of each of the
thirty-two spines is of the same shape, about half as long as the radius of
the spongy sphere; framework much looser in the outer than in the inner
part.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the sphere 0.8, of the central cube 0.02; length
of the spines 0.2, distal thickness 0.02.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 256, surface.


3. _Centrocubus polystylus_, n. sp.

Radial spines sixty to eighty, club-shaped, four to six times as broad at
the distal as at the basal end. Eight primary spines arise from the eight
corners of the regular, cubiform medullary shell, the remainder either
springing as lateral branches from the three denticulate corners of the
former, or arising within the spongy framework, which is much denser and

each spine is one-third as long as the radius.

{279}_Dimensions._--Diameter of the sphere 0.9, of the central cube 0.02;

Genus 119. _Octodendron_,[158] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Astrosphærida# with a single, cubical medullary shell, and
eight primary radial spines arising from its eight corners; these are
connected at equal distances by a latticed, spherical, cortical shell, from
which the spongy framework directly springs; often from the latter
secondary radial spines arise.

The genus _Octodendron_ has the same regular, cubical medullary shell as
the preceding _Centrocubus_, but differs from it in the wide interval
separating the medullary shell from the inner spherical face of the spongy
cortical shell, the two being connected only by eight radial beams, arising
from the eight corners of the cube.



Subgenus 1. _Octodendridium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Only eight primary radial spines, arising from the eight
corners of the central cube.


1. _Octodendron cubocentron_, n. sp. (Pl. 18, fig. 3).

Radial spines eight, club-shaped, with three denticulate, straight edges,
twice as long as the diameter of the central cavity of the cubical spongy
shell; the inner face of the latter (or the "inner cortical shell")
exhibits the form of a large cube, the spongy sides of which are parallel
with the simple square sides of the central cube. The thin eight radial
beams, connecting the corresponding corners of both cubes, are not thicker
than the edge-bars of the central cube, whilst their outer prolongations
are much thicker, with four to six verticils of lateral branches. Surface
of the thin walled, loose, spongy shell armed with short simple thorns.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy shell 0.2, of its inner cavity 0.1,
of the central cube 0.02; length of the spines 0.2 (from the centre 0.3).

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 266, surface.


2. _Octodendron spirale_, n. sp.

Radial spines eight, three-sided prismatic, three times as long as the
diameter of the inner shell-cavity; their three edges denticulated and
spirally contorted around the spine axis.  Thickness of the loose spongy
shell-wall equal to the radius of the inner cavity, three times as large as
the central cube. Surface covered, with numerous thin, bristle-shaped, bent
spinules.

3. _Octodendron pinetum_, n. sp.

Radial spines eight, three-sided prismatic, three to four times as long as
the diameter of the inner shell-cavity, with three spirally contorted
edges. From each spine arise at equal distances (equal to the half radius
of the cavity) fifteen to twenty verticils of branches which increase in
size from the base of the spine. Each verticil is composed of six forked
branches (two from each spine-edge); the inferior are richly branched, and
form by their connection the loose network of the spongy cortical shell,
the surface of which is covered with numerous bent threads. Each spine
bears a resemblance to a pine tree.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy shell 0.3, of its inner cavity 0.15,
of the central cube 0.02; length of the spines 0.5 to 0.6, breadth 0.01.

4. _Octodendron araucaria_, n. sp.

Radial spines eight, three-sided prismatic, with three spirally contorted
edges, eight to ten times as long as the diameter of the inner shell-cavity
(the free distal portion twice to three times as long). From each spine
arise at equal distances thirty to thirty-five verticils of branches, which
decrease in size towards the distal end. Each verticil is composed of six
forked branches (two from each spine-edge); the inferior are richly
ramified and form by their connection the loose spongy framework; the
distal branches bear on the free end elegant spathillæ (as in the following
species). Surface covered with innumerable straight bristles, as long as
the cavity radius, and ending with a spathilla.  Diameter of the central
capsule about equal to the radius of the spongy sphere, its membrane is
double-edged.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy shell 1.4 mm., of its inner cavity
0.14, of the central cube 0.02, of the central capsule 0.5 to 0.6; length

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 288, surface.


5. _Octodendron spathillatum_, n. sp. (Pl. 18, figs. 2, 4).

Radial spines eight, three-sided prismatic, with contorted edges, five to
eight times as long as the diameter of the shell-cavity (the free part
twice as long). From each spine arise ten to twelve verticils of lateral
branches; each verticil composed of three forked branches. The proximal
larger branches ramify richly, and form by their connection the loose
spongy framework of the spherical shell; the distal smaller branches are
simple or bifurcated, and the ramules are provided with an elegant
spathillum at the end (fig. 4). Entire surface of the spongy sphere covered
with innumerable bristle-shaped radial spines (half as long as the cavity
radius), zig-zag, bent, with beards, and with a spathillum at the end.

{281}_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy sphere 1 mm., of its central

Subgenus 2. _Octodendronium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Radial spines thirty-two or more, eight primary (arising
from the eight corners of the central cube) and twenty-four or more
secondary (between them).


6. _Octodendron verticillatum_, n. sp.

Radial spines thirty-two, with three denticulate straight edges, six to
eight times as long as the diameter of the shell-cavity; the distal parts
half free. Eight primary spines arise from the eight corners of the central
cube, twenty-four secondary from the edges of these (a verticil of every
three from each primary spine). Distal free parts of all thirty-two spines
equal. Each spine with eight to ten verticils of forked lateral branches,
without spathillæ. Surface of the spongy sphere covered with short simple
bristles.

7. _Octodendron contortum_, n. sp.

Radial spines thirty-two, disposed in a similar manner to those of the
former species (eight primary and twenty-four secondary); also the spongy
shell of the same shape. The difference arises in the form of the spines,
the three edges of which are much broader and spirally contorted around the
axis; and thus the corresponding branches of the verticil do not lie in the
same meridian-plane, but alternate one with another.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy shell 0.4, of its cavity 0.1, of the
central cube 0.02; length of the spines 0.8 to 1.2, breadth 0.04.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 274, surface.


8. _Octodendron arboretum_, n. sp.

Radial spines sixty to ninety, three-sided prismatic, with spirally
contorted and denticulate edges, six to eight times as long as the diameter
of the inner shell-cavity. Eight primary arise from the eight corners of
the central cube, twenty-four others from their three edges (as in the two
former species); the remaining thirty to sixty spines seem to arise between
the former and immediately from the dense spongy framework, which is twice
as thick as the diameter of the inner shell-cavity. The numerous verticils
of the free distal part are of equal shape in all the spines, composed of
three forked branches in the terminal, and of more ramified branches in the
inferior parts. Entire surface of the spongy shell covered with simple
radial bristles, without spathillæ.

{282}_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy shell 0.75, of its central
cavity 0.15, of the central cube 0.02; length of the spines 0.9 to 1.2,
breadth 0.02.

Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 54.

_Definition._--#Astrosphærida# with two concentric latticed medullary
shells, connected by radial beams; the outer is immediately enveloped by
the spongy framework, and bears numerous radial spines.

The genus _Spongosphæra_ (in the definition here restricted) differs from
_Spongopila_ in the double medullary shell, which in the latter is simple;
it exhibits to the latter the same relation that _Spongodictyon_ among the
Liosphærida bears to _Spongoplegma_. The outer medullary shell of
_Spongosphæra_ is immediately enveloped by the spongy wicker-work, which
everywhere pierces the wall of the central capsule.

Suborder PRUNOIDEA, Haeckel, 1883 (Pls. 13-17, 39, 40).

_Definition._--SPUMELLARIA with an ellipsoidal or cylindrical central
capsule, prolonged into one axis (sometimes articulate by annular
transverse strictures); with an ellipsoidal or cylindrical, fenestrated
siliceous shell (often articulate by annular strictures), invariably
prolonged into one axis. Fundamental form monaxon, usually with the poles
of the prolonged dimensive main axis equal.

The suborder #Prunoidea# comprises those SPUMELLARIA in which the
fenestrated spherical shell appears prolonged into one axis. The geometric
fundamental form of the shell, which in the #Sphæroidea# was a sphere, in
this case therefore becomes an ellipsoid, and whilst in the former all axes
originally have the same value (Homaxonia), {285}here one main axis is
constantly larger than all other axes (Monaxonia). Usually both poles of
this main axis are equal (Haplopola); but in some genera both poles become
different (Diplopola).

In the #Sphæroidea# all planes going through the centre of the shell are
circular, whereas in the #Prunoidea# only those planes are circular which
are perpendicular to the main axis; all other planes going through the
centre are elliptical; the largest of these are the meridian planes, in
which is situated the main axis. Commonly all meridian planes are equal, as
no transverse axes (or cross axes) are differentiated.

In my Monograph (1862) only very few forms of #Prunoidea#, such as
_Didymocyrtis_ and _Spongurus_, are described, and the greater part of them
are distributed under different genera of #Sphæroidea#, such as _Haliomma_
and _Actinomma_. In my Prodromus (1881) I separated them as the family
Zygartida (p. 462). But it seems now much more convenient to restrict this
term to a particular family and to give a wider extension to the whole
suborder under the name #Prunoidea# (called after the characteristic
ellipsoidal form of a plum, or _Prunus_, with its stone).

The suborder #Prunoidea# comprises seven different families, of which the
Ellipsida constitutes the simplest and the probable common ancestral group.
In all Ellipsida the fenestrated shell is simple, and never composed of
concentric or twin shells. In their primitive genus _Cenellipsis_, the
whole shell is geometrically nothing more than a simple ellipsoid (Pl. 39,
figs. 1, 2). By development of radial spines it passes into _Ellipsidium_,
by development of spongy framework into _Spongellipsis_. In the greater
part of this family large spines are developed on both poles of the main
axis of the shell, but sometimes instead of these solid spines, two
opposite hollow fenestrated tubes are developed (_Pipettella_, Pl. 39, fig.
6).

The second family of #Prunoidea#, the Druppulida, is much richer in
different forms than the simple Ellipsida. In this case the ellipsoidal
shell is composed of two or three (rarely more) concentric shells.
Constantly one or two of these fenestrated shells are enclosed in the
central capsule, and may therefore be called "medullary shells"; and one or
two (rarely more) lie outside the central capsule, "cortical shells." The
inner medullary shells (one or two) are either spherical or ellipsoidal;
the outer cortical shells (one or two, rarely more) are always ellipsoidal.
All concentric shells are connected by radial beams. In the simplest form
of the subfamily, _Druppula_ (Pl. 39, fig. 3), one medullary shell is
connected with one cortical shell. By duplication of the medullary shell
arises _Prunulum_ (Pl. 39, fig. 4), and by duplication or multiplication of
the cortical shell _Cromyodruppa_ (Pl. 15, figs. 1-4) is formed. In by far
the greater portion of this subfamily large spines are developed on both
poles of the main axis of the cortical shell (Pls. 16, 17), but sometimes
also instead of these solid spines two opposite hollow fenestrated tubes
are developed (_Pipetta_, Pl. 39, figs. 7, 8).

{286}A third family of #Prunoidea#, closely allied to the two preceding
families, is the Spongurida, in which we include all #Prunoidea# with an
ellipsoidal or cylindrical, unjointed shell, in which the lattice-work of
the cortical shell is transformed into an irregular, siliceous framework.
In the simplest form, _Spongellipsis_, the simple lattice-shell of
_Cenellipsis_ is substituted by an external spongy envelope. In other cases
(_Spongurus_ and allied genera) the whole cavity of this external spongy
shell is distended with a fine spongy framework. The subfamily of
Spongodruppida is distinguished by the possession of a simple or double
latticed medullary shell; this lies in the midst of the central capsule,
and is connected by radial beams (perforating its membrane) with the
enveloping spongy cortical shell. The surface of the latter may bear either
radial spines, or two opposite strong polar spines, at the poles of the
main axis (Pl. 17, fig. 12).

Closely allied to the Ellipsida and Druppulida are two other families of
the #Prunoidea#, the Artiscida and Cyphinida, which differ from the former
by a circular constriction in the equatorial plane of the ellipsoidal
shell; and in this way assume a characteristic twin form, like a figure of
eight. In the Artiscida the shell is simple (as in the Ellipsida), whereas
in the Cyphinida it is composed of two or more concentric shells (as in the
Druppulida). The simplest form of the Artiscida is _Artiscus_ (Pl. 39, fig.
9), differing from _Cenellipsis_ in the ring-shaped, equatorial
constriction. In other Artiscida polar appendages are developed on both
poles of the main axis, either in the form of solid, strong spines
(_Stylartus_), or hollow fenestrated tubes (_Cannartus_, Pl. 39, fig. 10).

The family Cyphinida differs from the Druppulida in the equatorial
constriction of the shell, and from the Artiscida in the presence of two or
more concentric shells. One or two of these concentric fenestrated shells
are enclosed in the central capsule (and therefore may be called "medullary
shells"); the others (one or two, rarely more) lie outside of the central
capsule (therefore "cortical shells"). The internal "medullary shells" are
always spherical or somewhat lenticular, compressed from both sides; the
external "cortical shells" have constantly a ring-like constriction in the
equatorial plane, and "twin-shells" are therefore like a figure of eight.
The simplest form of this subfamily is _Cyphanta_, composed of a simple
medullary shell and a simple cortical shell, the two being connected in the
equatorial plane by radial beams. In Cyphonium (Pl. 39, fig. 12) the
medullary shell is doubled, and in _Cypassis_ (Pl. 39, fig. 13) the
cortical shell likewise. On both poles of the main axis strong spines are
often developed (_Cyphinus_, Pl. 39, fig. 14), or hollow fenestrated tubes
(_Cannartidium_, Pl. 39, figs. 16-19).

The equatorial constriction of the ellipsoidal shell, which characterises
the Artiscida and Cyphinida, is repeated or multiplied in the two following
families, in the Panartida and Zygartida; in the former we find three
ring-like strictures, in the latter five or more (lying in parallel
transverse planes); therefore the fenestrated shell is composed in the one
instance of four chambers, in the other of six or {287}more; all the
chambers form a single series and have a common main axis. All
constrictions lie in planes parallel to the equatorial plane of the
original ellipsoid; in the centre of the latter constantly lies a double
"medullary shell," composed of two concentric, either spherical or
lenticular, compressed shells. In all Panartida we call the two inner
chambers (on both sides of the equatorial constriction) "proximal
chambers," the two outer chambers (on the poles of the main axis) "distal
chambers." The four-chambered cortical shell of the Panartida is either
simple (in _Panartus_, Pl. 40, figs. 1-4) or double, with an external
mantle (as in _Peripanartus_, Pl. 40, figs. 5-7). The simplest form of the
subfamily is _Panartus_ (_loc. cit._). In this case also on both poles of
the main axis may be developed solid spines, or hollow fenestrated tubes
(_Panarium_, Pl. 40, fig. 9).

The seventh and last family of the #Prunoidea#, the Zygartida is most
nearly allied to the Panartida, and appears as a further developmental step
from that family. Whilst in the Panartida the cortical shell is constantly
four-chambered, with three parallel ring-like constrictions, in the
Zygartida it is always prolonged and composed of six or more chambers,
separated by five or more ring-shaped constrictions, in the middle of which
is the equatorial stricture. In the centre of the latter (as also in the
Panartida) always lies the double medullary shell, composed of two
concentric, spherical, or lenticular shells. The number of the chambers of
the cortical shells is commonly six or eight (with five to seven ring
strictures), but it often mounts to ten and sometimes to twenty (with
nineteen strictures), as in some species of _Zygartus_ (Pl. 40, fig. 13).
All the chambers lie in one series, one behind another, with a common main
axis. The cortical shell is usually simple (in _Ommatocampe_, Pl. 40, fig.
10), sometimes double (in _Desmocampe_, Pl. 40, fig. 12), rarely triple (in
ZYGOCAMPE, Pl. 40, fig. 13). In all three cases hollow fenestrated tubes
may be developed on the poles of the main axis.

The morphological references and the phylogenetic affinities of all
#Prunoidea# are so complex, that they seem to represent a quite natural
group; all forms of it may be derived from the common ancestral form
_Cenellipsis_. But a far more difficult question is the manner in which its
pedigree may be constructed. The oldest family is probably the simplest,
namely, Ellipsida. From this the Druppulida may be derived by production of
medullary shells, the Artiscida by equatorial constriction. The Cyphinida
can be produced either from the Druppulida by equatorial constriction or
from the Artiscida by development of medullary shells. The Panartida appear
as further developmental steps of the Cyphinida, by duplication of the
chamber number; and the Zygartida as further productions of the Panartida,
by increasing the number of the chambers.

The seven subfamilies of the #Prunoidea# can be arranged in two sections
according to the presence or absence of medullary shells. The Ellipsida,
Spongellipsida, and Artiscida possess a simple cortical shell, without a
medullary shell; they represent the {288}section Cenoprunida. All other
families possess medullary shells, and so represent the section
Coccoprunida.

Another character, which can be employed in the arrangement of the seven
subfamilies in some larger groups, is the presence or absence of ring-like
constrictions, by which the cortical shell is divided into chambers. I. The
Monoprunida comprise all forms without any constriction, of which the
Ellipsida are without a medullary shell, the Druppulida with one or two
medullary shells, and the Spongurida with a spongy cortical shell. II. The
Dyoprunida contain all forms with a cortical twin shell, or with two
chambers separated by one equatorial constriction, of which the Artiscida
are without a medullary shell and the Cyphinida have one or two medullary
shells. III. The Polyprunida comprise all forms with several (three or
more) constrictions, which separate four or more chambers, of which the
Panartida have three constrictions and four chambers, and the Zygartida
five or more constrictions and six or more chambers.

_The Central Capsule_ of the #Prunoidea# is originally ellipsoidal
(monaxial), and preserves this form in the greater part of the genera. In
some groups, where the axis of the ellipsoid is much prolonged, it passes
over to the cylindrical form (with hemispherical vaultings on both poles),
as in _Spongurus_ and _Spongocore_, in many Panartida and Zygartida. Very
often the ellipsoidal or cylindrical capsule gets annular transverse
constrictions, corresponding to those of the enveloping cortical shell (one
single, equatorial stricture in the Artiscida and Cyphinida, three
strictures in the Panartida, five or more in the Zygartida). In the
Cenoprunida (Ellipsida and Artiscida, also in _Spongellipsis_) the central
capsule lies freely in the cavity of the cortical shell, separated from its
inner surface by the jelly-envelope; in all other groups it contains a part
of the skeleton, the medullary shell and the beams which connect it with
the enveloping cortical shell.

{289}Family XI. #ELLIPSIDA#, Haeckel, 1882 (Pls. 13, 14, 39).

_Definition._--#Prunoidea# with simple ellipsoidal shell, without
equatorial stricture (without enclosed medullary shell); network a simple
lattice lamella, not spongy. Central capsule ellipsoidal or cylindrical,
without annular equatorial constriction.

The family #Ellipsida# comprises the simplest forms of #Prunoidea#, and
probably represents the ancestral forms of this whole suborder. The
fenestrated shell, which encloses the ellipsoidal central capsule, is a
perfectly simple "cortical shell" of the same form, without enclosed
"medullary shell." Its form is commonly a regular monaxial ellipsoid;
sometimes a little modified by unequal growth of the two poles of the main
axis. Two opposite large spines are often developed at these poles, or it
may be that instead of these, two hollow fenestrated tubes are present.

The ellipsoidal fenestrated shell exhibits in the regular Ellipsida all the
characters of a geometric ellipsoid; one main axis surpasses in length all
other possible axes. All sections going through this main axis are
"meridian sections," with elliptical periphery; all sections perpendicular
to the main axis are "transverse sections," with circular periphery. The
largest of these is the equatorial section, which divides the main axis
into halves. The diameter of this equatorial plane is the "minor axis" of
the ellipsoid.

The proportion of the two axes of the ellipsoidal shell, of the major
vertical or main axis and the minor horizontal or equatorial axis, is
commonly between 6 : 5 and 3 : 2. In the former case it approaches the
spherical shell, from which it is derived; in the latter case it becomes
almost fusiform or cylindrical. The network of silex, constituting the
shell, is constantly a simple latticed lamella, never composed of
concentric shells (as in Druppulida) or spongy (as in Spongurida). The
network is often very regular and elegant, in other cases irregular.

The simplest genus among the Ellipsida, and probably the common ancestral
form of the whole subfamily, is the genus _Cenellipsis_, possessing a
simple ellipsoidal shell without any appendages. It is derived from
_Cenosphæra_ (the simplest spherical shell) by the prolongation of one
axis. _Cenellipsis_ passes over into _Ellipsidium_ by the production of
radial spines on the surface (corresponding to _Heliosphæra_). _Axellipsis_
is a peculiar genus differing from _Cenellipsis_ in an axial rod, which
corresponds to the minor or equatorial axis. In all other genera of the
subfamily both poles of the main axis are distinguished by peculiar polar
prolongations, either hollow fenestrated tubes (as in _Pipettella_) or
strong solid spines. Both polar spines are of equal size and similar form
in _Ellipsoxiphus_, unequal in _Ellipsostylus_. From the latter is derived
_Lithapium_, by reduction and loss of one spine (so that only one remains);
_Lithomespilus_, by production of a bunch of several spines at one pole. In
the three latter genera both poles of the main axis are unequal, in all
others equal.

{290}The central capsule of the Ellipsida is in all cases ellipsoidal, and
occupies the largest part of the shell, being separated from its inner
surface by a thinner or thicker jelly-mantle.

Genus 122. _Cenellipsis_,[161] n. gen.

_Definition_.--#Ellipsida# with simple ellipsoidal shell, without radial
spines and without polar tubes.

The genus _Cenellipsis_ is the simplest and most primitive form, not only
among the Ellipsida, but also among the #Prunoidea#, and it may therefore
be regarded as the common ancestral form of the whole family. It
corresponds to _Cenosphæra_ among the #Sphæroidea#, to _Cenodiscus_ among
the #Discoidea#, to _Cenolarcus_ among the #Larcoidea#.  Probably it is
derived from _Cenosphæra_ by prolongation of one axis.

Genus 123. _Axellipsis_,[162] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Ellipsida# with simple ellipsoidal shell, without radial
spines or polar tubes, but with an inner transverse axial rod, which
corresponds to the shorter axis of the ellipsoid.

The genus _Axellipsis_ differs from the simple _Cenellipsis_ in a very
peculiar character, namely, the presence of an inner siliceous bar marking
the minor axis of the ellipsoidal shell. If in some forms of _Druppula_
(e.g., Pl. 39, fig. 3) we remove the central medullary shell and prolong
both beams (connecting it with the cortical shell) till they unite in the
centre, we shall arrive at _Axellipsis_. Therefore _Axellipsis_ may be
derived in the same way from _Druppula_ as _Axoprunum_ is from
_Lithatractus_, by phyletic loss of the medullary shell.


1. _Axellipsis perforata_, n. sp.

irregular, roundish, lobed, with three to six indentations (each mesh
formed by the confluence of three to six, commonly {294}four or five,
smaller pores); eight to nine meshes on the half equator, these being twice
to four times as broad as the bars.

_Dimensions._--Longer axis of the shell 0.1, shorter axis 0.08; pores 0.007
to 0.01, bars 0.003.

Genus 124. _Ellipsidium_,[163] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Ellipsida# with simple ellipsoidal shell, with numerous
radial spines on the surface, without polar spines or tubes.

The genus _Ellipsidium_ differs from _Cenellipsis_ solely in the
development of numerous radial spines on the surface, and exhibits the same
phylogenetic relation to it that _Heliosphæra_ bears to _Cenosphæra_.


1. _Ellipsidium pandanidium_, n. sp.

Proportion of the longer axis of the ellipsoid to the shorter = 5 : 4.
Shell thick walled, with regular and hexagonal meshes, twice as broad as

about as long as the diameter of the meshes. (The shell is similar to the
outer shell of _Haliomma castanea_, Haeckel, Monogr. d. Radiol., Taf. xxiv.
fig. 4.)

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the ellipsoid 0.12, minor axis 0.09; meshes

Proportion of the longer axis to the shorter = 5 : 4. Shell thin walled,
with irregular, roundish meshes of different size and form, about twice to
three times as broad as the irregular, thin bars between them; ten to
fifteen meshes on the half equator. Between the meshes arise numerous thin,
bristle-like, radial spines, about as long as the shorter radius of the
shell. The number of the meshes may be three to four times as great as the
number of the spines.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the ellipsoid 0.15, minor axis 0.12; pores
0.006 to 0.01, bars 0.003 to 0.004.

_Habitat._--Southern Pacific, Station 284, surface.


5. _Ellipsidium echinidium_, n. sp.

Proportion of the longer axis to the shorter = 4 : 3. Shell thick walled,
with irregular, roundish pores of different size and form, about as large
or somewhat smaller than the broad bars; twelve to sixteen pores on the
half equator. On the surface, irregularly scattered, twenty to thirty
strong, three-sided pyramidal, radial spines, one-fourth to one-half as
long as the main axis.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the ellipsoid 0.16, minor 0.12; pores and bars
0.002 to 0.008; length of the radial spines 0.04 to 0.08, basal breadth

Genus 125. _Ellipsoxiphus_,[164] Dunikowski, 1882, Denkschr. d. k. Akad. d.
Wiss. Wien, vol. xlv. p. 25.

_Definition._--#Ellipsida# with simple ellipsoidal shell, the main axis of
which is prolonged at both poles into two strong opposite spines of equal
size and similar form.

The genus _Ellipsoxiphus_ was established by Dunikowski (in 1882, _loc.
cit._) for those simple amphistylous fenestrated shells, formerly united
with _Xiphosphæra_, in which the mathematical form of the shell itself is
not a true sphere, but an ellipsoid. It may therefore be derived from
_Xiphosphæra_ by prolongation of the axis in which lie both polar spines;
but it may also be derived from _Cenellipsis_ by the production of two
equal spines at the poles of the main axis.

_Definition._--Network of the shell regular, with pores of equal size and

1. _Ellipsoxiphus elegans_, n. sp. (Pl. 14, fig. 7).

Proportion of the major axis of the ellipsoid to the minor = 5 : 4. Shell
thick walled, with regular, circular meshes, separated by a regular,
hexagonal elevated framework. From each hexagon-corner arises (between
every three meshes) a short thin spine, about as long as the diameter of a
mesh; twelve to fourteen meshes on the half equator, of the same breadth as
the bars. Polar spines three-sided prismatic, cuspidate, about as long as
the axis of the shell. (This elegant and not uncommon species is remarkable
for its variations. By unequal development of both spines it passes over to
_Ellipsostylus_.) In the figured variety (Pl. 14, fig. 7) the ends of the
surface spines are connected by a very delicate network, so as to form an
outer veil. This may further be separated as a peculiar genus
_Ellipsoxiphium palliatum_.

_Dimensions._--Longer axis 0.08 to 0.13, shorter axis 0.06 to 0.11; pores
and bars 0.008; length of the polar spines 0.06 to 0.12, basal breadth
0.01.

with regular, hexagonal meshes, eight to nine on the half equator, three to
four times as broad as the bars. The inner contour of the meshes is

fig. 9). Polar spines three-sided pyramidal, about as long as the major
axis of the shell; their basal thickness equals one mesh.

_Dimensions._--Longer axis 0.12, shorter axis 0.1; pores 0.012 to 0.015,

0.004; length of the polar spines 0.09, basal breadth 0.008.

Genus 126. _Axoprunum_,[165] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Ellipsida# with simple ellipsoidal shell, the main axis of
which is prolonged at both poles into two opposite spines of equal size and
similar form. Within the cavity of the shell four radial rods arise from
its inner surface, two in the main axis, two in the smallest axis,
perpendicular to the former; their free inner ends are at the same distance
from the centre.

The genus _Axoprunum_ possesses precisely the same shell as the foregoing
_Ellipsoxiphus_, but differs from it in a very remarkable peculiarity. The
two polar spines are centripetally prolonged into two internal beams, and
perpendicular to these are two other, opposite, transverse beams, marking
the minor axis of the ellipsoid. The free inner ends of all four radial
rods bear little thickened knobs, and are at the same distance from the
centre. It therefore appears as though a central, spherical, medullary
shell had been lost, and this gives a strong support to the important
hypothesis, that in many #Sphærellaria#, where the medullary shell is
absent, it may have been lost by phylogenetic reduction or retrograde
metamorphosis. In this case _Axoprunum_ (and _Ellipsoxiphus_) would arise
from _Lithatractus_.


1. _Axoprunum stauraxonium_, n. sp. (Pl. 48, fig. 4).

Shell ellipsoidal, one and one-third times as long as broad, with smooth
surface. Network regular, with circular meshes four times as broad as the
bars. Two polar spines three-sided pyramidal, half as long as the shell, as
thick at the base as a single mesh. Four inner radial beams (lying, two in
the major and two in the minor axis of the ellipsoid) very thin, at the
central free ends knob-like, thickened. The distance between two opposite
beams equals one-third of the minor axis, and indicates probably the
diameter of the lost spherical medullary shell. (Three perfect and complete
specimens of the same size and shape were observed.)

{299}_Dimensions._--Major axis of the ellipsoid 0.14, minor axis 0.11;

Genus 127. _Ellipsostylus_,[166] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Ellipsida# with simple ellipsoidal shell, the main axis of
which is prolonged at both poles into two opposite spines of different size
or form.

The genus _Ellipsostylus_ differs from _Ellipsoxiphus_ only in the unequal
size or different form of the polar spines, which in the former are equal.
This difference does not seem important at first, but in the further
development it produces very singular and strange forms. Theoretically it
is always important, because the fundamental haplopolar form of the monaxon
body becomes diplopolar by this differentiation.

Genus 128. _Lithomespilus_,[167] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 450.

_Definition._--#Ellipsida# with simple ellipsoidal or oviform shell, the
main axis of which bears at one pole a single spine, at the other a bunch
of several spines.

{302}The genus _Lithomespilus_ differs from the closely allied
_Ellipsoxiphus_ in the further differentiation of both poles of the main
axis. One pole exhibits only a single polar spine, the other pole a group
of several spines, peculiarly grouped together. It differs from the similar
_Sphæromespilus_ (Pl. 14, figs. 12, 13) in the ellipsoidal form of the
shell.


1. _Lithomespilus phloginus_, n. sp. (Pl. 14, fig. 16).

Proportion of the major axis of the ellipsoid to the minor = 4 : 3. Shell
thick walled, with circular pores of different size, the breadth of which
equals that of the bars; twelve to fifteen pores on the half equator.
Surface smooth, with the exception of a circumpolar region covered with
numerous thick spines of unequal size, which surround the large single
polar spine and are curved like a bow against its axis. This larger polar
spine is straight, and equals in length the major axis of the shell. The
other and opposite polar spine is scarcely one-fourth as long, perfectly
simple, very stout, and of a three-sided pyramidal shape.

_Dimensions._--Longer axis of the ellipsoidal shell 0.08, shorter axis
0.06; pores 0.002 to 0.006, bars 0.003 to 0.005; length of the polar
spines--longer 0.08, shorter 0.02.

_Habitat._--Indian Ocean, near Madagascar, depth 1200 fathoms, Smith.


2. _Lithomespilus phlogoides_, n. sp. (Pl. 14, fig. 17).

Proportion of the major axis to the minor = 5 : 4. Shell very thick walled,
with roundish, double-contoured pores of different size and form, twice to
three times as broad as the bars; sixteen to eighteen pores on the half
equator. Surface smooth, with the exception of a circumpolar region covered
with numerous thin spines of unequal size, which surround the large single
polar spine and are curved like a bow against its axis. This larger polar
spine is straight, and equals half the size of the major axis of the shell;
the other polar spine (sometimes double, as in the figured specimen) is
much shorter, being scarcely one-fourth as long.

_Dimensions._--Longer axis of the shell 0.08, shorter axis 0.065; pores
0.003 to 0.006, bars 0.002 to 0.004; length of the polar spines--longer
0.04, shorter 0.01.

2925 fathoms.


3. _Lithomespilus flammeus_, n. sp.

  _Stylosphæra species_, Bury, 1862, Polycystins of Barbados, pl. xi. fig.
  3.

Proportion of the major axis to the minor = 4 : 3. Shell thick walled, with
irregular, roundish pores, about as broad as the bars; ten to twelve pores
on the half equator. Surface spiny. Length of the conical straight spines
increasing towards the poles; each polar spine surrounded by a circumpolar
group of larger, somewhat curved spines. The larger polar spine equals in
length the major axis; the smaller is scarcely half as long. (The figure,
given by Bury, is not quite exact; there the spines are situated in the
pores, instead of between them. In my specimen the polar spines were not
branched.)

{303}_Dimensions._--Longer axis of the shell 0.12, shorter axis 0.09; pores
and bars 0.004 to 0.006; length of the polar spines--longer 0.12, shorter

_Habitat._--Fossil in Barbados.


4. _Lithomespilus flammabundus_, n. sp. (Pl. 14, fig. 14).

Proportion of the major axis to the minor = 4 : 3. Shell thin walled, with
irregular, roundish pores, partly simple, partly composed of three to six
confluent pores; only six to eight pores on the half equator, twice to four
times as broad as the bars. Surface spiny. Length of the conical irregular
spines increasing towards the poles; each polar spine surrounded by a
flame-shaped, circumpolar area of longer spines; all large spines (also the
polar spines) curved or contorted at one pole and much stronger and more
numerous than at the other; length variable, often equal to the longer
axis.

_Dimensions._--Longer axis of the shell 0.12, shorter axis 0.09; pores
0.005 to 0.015, bars 0.003 to 0.005; length of the polar spines 0.1 to
0.15.

_Habitat._--Western part of the Tropical Atlantic, Station 347, depth 2250

Genus 129. _Lithapium_,[168] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Ellipsida# with simple ellipsoidal or pear-shaped shell;
with a single spine only situated at one pole of the main axis.

The genus _Lithapium_ represents a peculiar modification of
_Ellipsoxiphus_; one of the two opposite polar spines disappears by
reduction, and in this way only a single spine remains, at one pole of the
main axis. For this reason the shell assumes a characteristic pear-shape,
and may easily be confounded with some similar Monocyrtida (_Halicapsa_).


1. _Lithapium pyriforme_, n. sp. (Pl. 14, fig. 9).

Proportion of the longer axis to the shorter = 6 : 5. Shell thin walled,
with regular, circular pores, four times as broad as the bars; six to eight
on the half equator. Surface a little thorny. The single polar spines
three-sided pyramidal, as broad at the base as one mesh, about as long as
the radius of the shell. (In the specimen figured, there was on the
opposite pole a little rudiment of the other lost polar spine; it is
missing in other specimens.)

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the ellipsoidal shell 0.12, minor axis 0.1;
pores 0.02, bars 0.005; length of the single polar spine 0.05, basal
thickness 0.02.

_Habitat._--Central area of the Pacific, Station 266, depth 2750 fathoms.


2. _Lithapium halicapsa_, n. sp. (Pl. 14, fig. 8).

Proportion of the longer axis to the shorter = 6 : 5. Shell thin walled,
with irregular, lobed meshes, six to eight on the half equator, twice to
five times as broad as the bars; each mesh {304}composed of two to five
confluent roundish pores. Surface a little thorny. The single polar spine
pyramidal, as broad at the base as one mesh, one-third as long as the axis.

_Dimensions._--Major axis 0.12, minor axis 0.1; pores 0.01 to 0.02, bars
0.002 to 0.006; length of the single polar spine 0.03, basal thickness
0.02.

_Habitat._--Central area of the Pacific, Station 270, depth 2925 fathoms.


3. _Lithapium monocyrtis_, n. sp. (Pl. 14, fig. 10).

Proportion of the longer axis to the shorter = 7 : 6. Shell thick walled,
with irregular, lobed meshes, four to six on the half equator, three to six
times as broad as the bars; each mesh composed of three to six confluent
roundish pores. Surface quite smooth, without thorns. The single polar
spine pyramidal, as broad at the base as the largest mesh, half as long as
the radius. (This species is closely allied to the foregoing, but differs
in the smooth surface and the larger meshes.)

_Dimensions._--Major axis 0.15, minor axis 0.13; pores 0.01 to 0.03, bars
0.003 to 0.01; length of the single spine 0.04, basal thickness 0.03.

Genus 130. _Pipettella_,[169] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Ellipsida# with simple ellipsoidal shell, the main axis of
which is prolonged at the pole into two opposite hollow fenestrated tubes
of equal size and similar form.

The genus _Pipettella_ is distinguished from the other Ellipsida by two
hollow perforated tubes, which are directed in the longer axis of the
ellipsoidal shell and arise from opposite poles of this axis. It may be
derived from _Cenellipsis_ by prolongation of both poles of the main axis.
As the same peculiar production of two opposite latticed tubuli at the
poles of the main axis obtains in nearly all families of #Prunoidea#
(_Pipetta_, _Cannartus_, _Panarium_, _Zygartus_, &c.), it may possess a
peculiar value in this group.


1. _Pipettella fusiformis_, n. sp.

Shell spindle-shaped, thin walled, the two opposite tubes being conical and
not longer than the short transverse axis of the ellipsoidal shell; no
sharp demarcation between them. The two axes of the ellipsoid bear the
proportion of 3 : 2. Network of the shell and of the tubes equal, delicate,
regular, hexagonal, with circular apertures of equal size; fourteen to
sixteen on the half equator of the shell. Bars very thin. The shell of this
species is similar to that of _Cannartiscus amphiconiscus_ (Pl. 39, fig.
19), but possesses no equatorial stricture and no medullary shell.

_Dimensions._--Longer axis of the ellipsoid 0.18, shorter axis 0.12; length
of the tubes 0.1, their basal breadth 0.05; pores of the network 0.01, bars
0.001.

_Habitat._--Northern Pacific, Station 244, depth 2900 fathoms.


{305}2. _Pipettella tubulosa_, n. sp.

Shell ellipsoidal, thin walled, distinctly separated from the two opposite
tubes, which are cylindrical, longer than the main axis of the ellipsoid,
and one-sixth as broad as the shorter axis. The longer axis of the
ellipsoid bears to the shorter the proportion of 5 : 4. Network of the
shell and of the tubes equal, regular, with very small circular pores,
about as broad as the bars; sixteen to eighteen pores on the half equator
of the shell.

_Dimensions._--Longer axis of the ellipsoid 0.15, shorter axis 0.12; length
of the tubes 0.16 to 0.2, breadth of them 0.02; pores of the network 0.003,
bars 0.003.

_Habitat._--Western Tropical Pacific, Station 225, depth 4475 fathoms.


3. _Pipettella elongata_, n. sp.

Shell ellipsoidal, thick walled, distinctly separated from both opposite
tubes, which are cylindrical, much prolonged, twice to three times as long
as the main axis of the ellipsoid, and one-fifth as broad as the shorter
axis. Both axes of the ellipsoid bear the proportion of 3 : 2. Network of
the shell and of the tubes irregular with small rounded pores of different
size, separated by broader bars (often twice to three times as broad), four
to six pores on the half equator of the shell. (This species somewhat
recalls _Solenosphæra serpentina_, Pl. 7, fig. 7; but the tubes are
straight, not contorted.)

_Dimensions._--Longer axis of the ellipsoid 0.2, shorter axis 0.14; length
of the tubes 0.4 to 0.5, breadth 0.03; pores of the network 0.001 to 0.002,
bars 0.003 to 0.004.

_Habitat._--Central area of the Pacific, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.


4. _Pipettella prismatica_, n. sp. (Pl. 39, fig. 6).

Shell ellipsoidal, thick walled, distinctly marked off from the two
opposite tubes, which are longer than its main axis and as broad as
one-fifth of it; they are nearly four-sided prismatic, with four strong
ribs or edges; these are directed parallel to the main axis, in two
meridian planes, perpendicular to one another. The wall of the shell is
thickened in the equatorial plane, so as to form a slight stricture on the
inside, separating its two halves. Both axes of the ellipsoid bear the
proportion of 7 : 6. Network regular, with circular pores, somewhat broader
than the bars. The meshes of the shell (fourteen to sixteen on the half
equator) are twice as great as those of the tubes, which are arranged in
two longitudinal rows between every two ribs (there being eight
longitudinal rows on the whole tube). This species is very remarkable for
the rudimentary internal equatorial stricture of the shell (transition to
the genus _Cannartus_, Pl. 39, fig. 10), and by the four edges of the
tubes, which indicate two of the dimensive axes, the third being

{306}Family XII. #DRUPPULIDA#, Haeckel, 1882 (Pls. 15, 16, 17, 39).

_Definition._--#Prunoidea# with ellipsoidal, latticed (not spongy) shell,
composed of two or more concentric shells; a simple or double cortical
shell enclosing one or two internal concentric shells (medullary shells),
without equatorial stricture. Central capsule ellipsoidal or cylindrical,
without annular equatorial constriction.

The family #Druppulida# differs from the Ellipsida only in the possession
of a simple or double medullary shell, which is enclosed in the centre of
the central capsule, and connected with the ellipsoidal cortical shell
(lying outside it) by radial beams, perforating the membrane of the
capsule. The Druppulida exhibit therefore the same relation to the
Ellipsida that the Dyosphærida among the #Sphæroidea# bear to the
Monosphærida. The cortical shell may be simple or multiple. The whole
fenestrated shell is thus composed of a variable number (two at least) of
concentric shells, which are connected by radial beams.

_The Medullary Shell_--enclosed in the centre of the central capsule--is
either simple or double, and composed of two small concentric shells. Their
form is either spherical, or ellipsoidal, or lenticular. If the medullary
shell be ellipsoidal, the main axis of the ellipsoid is the same as in the
cortical shell. Sometimes the inner medullary shell is spherical, the outer
ellipsoidal or lenticular. If the medullary shell be lenticular (arising
from both poles of the main axis) its vertical axis is also identical with
that of the cortical shell (Pl. 39, fig. 5).

_The Radial Beams_, which connect the medullary and cortical shell, are
either developed in all possible directions (Pls. 16, 17), or limited to
the equatorial plane, more rarely to the meridional plane. Sometimes the
connection is produced only by two opposite beams which lie in the minor or
equatorial axis (Pl. 39, figs. 3, 7, 8); more rarely in the major or
meridional axis (Pl. 17, figs. 7, 8).

_The Cortical Shell_ is constantly ellipsoidal, rarely with modifications,
similar to those which appear in the simple shell of some Ellipsida. As a
rule it is simple, rarely composed of two or more (sometimes six or more)
concentric ellipsoidal shells (in _Cromyodruppa_ and _Cromyocarpus_). The
outer surface is commonly smooth, more rarely covered with radial spines
(in _Druppocarpus_, _Prunocarpus_, &c.). In the majority peculiar polar
appendages are developed at both poles of the main axis, these being
prolongations of them, either in the form of hollow fenestrated tubes
(_Pipetta_, _Pipettaria_, Pl. 39, figs. 7, 8), or solid strong spines. The
two polar spines are either equal in size and similar in form (as in
_Lithatractus_, _Stylatractus_) or unequal (as in _Druppatractus_,
_Xiphatractus_, Pls. 16, 17).

The most primitive of all Druppulida is _Druppula_, with simple medullary
shell and simple cortical shell (Pl. 39, fig. 3); _Prunulum_ differs from
it only in the possession {307}of a double medullary shell (Pl. 39, fig.
4). From these two genera all other forms of the subfamily may be derived.

_The Central Capsule_ of the Druppulida is constantly ellipsoidal, larger
than the concentric enclosed medullary shells, smaller than the surrounding
cortical shell; it is separated from the inner surface of the latter by a
thinner or thicker jelly-mantle.

Genus 131. _Druppula_,[170] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Druppulida# with simple ellipsoidal, cortical shell, and
simple medullary shell, without spines or polar tubes.

The genus _Druppula_, as the simplest form of the Druppulida, may be
regarded as the common ancestral form of this subfamily. It may be derived
phylogenetically either {308}from _Carposphæra_ by prolongation of one
axis, or from _Cenellipsis_ by duplication of the fenestrated shell. The
outer (or cortical) shell is always more or less ellipsoidal; the inner (or
medullary) shell also is sometimes ellipsoidal, sometimes spherical. Both
shells are concentric, connected by a variable number of radial beams.

The genus _Druppocarpus_ differs from _Druppula_ only in the radial spines,
which arise between the pores of the cortical shell, and therefore exhibits
the same relation to it that _Ellipsidium_ bears to _Cenellipsis_, or
_Prunocarpus_ to _Prunulum_.

double medullary shell; without spines or polar tubes.

The genus _Prunulum_ differs from _Druppula_ in the double (not simple)

  _Caryolithis crenata_, Ehrenberg, 1847, Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad. d.
  Wiss. Berlin, p. 43.

Cortical shell thick walled, slightly rough or thorny, with small, regular,
circular pores, of the same breadth as the bars; sixteen to eighteen on the
half equator. Proportion of the two axes = 4 : 3. Both medullary shells
ellipsoidal. (The figure of Stöhr represents exactly the fossil form, as I
have observed it myself in the Caltanisetta rocks, whilst the figure of

bristle-like spines. Pores small, regular, circular, of the same breadth as
the bars; fourteen to sixteen on the half equator. Proportion of the two

Ehrenberg--as is very often the case--is quite incongruent with his figure.
From a combination of both I give here the diagnosis of a deep-sea species,
which is possibly identical with it. The velvet-like covering of very short

three times as broad as the bars; twelve to fourteen on the half equator.

double medullary shell, with numerous radial spines, but without polar

The genus _Prunocarpus_ differs from _Prunulum_ only in the radial spines
of the cortical shell, and exhibits therefore the same relation to it that
_Druppocarpus_ bears to _Druppula_. While in the latter the medullary shell
is simple, in the former it is double.

sizes, twice to nine times as broad as the thin bars; ten to fifteen on the
half equator. Between them arise numerous bristle-shaped, radial spines,
with conical base, on an average one-fourth to two-thirds as long as the

presents a transverse ellipsoid, its main axis lying in the equatorial axis
of the cortical shell, whilst its equatorial axis corresponds to the main
axis of the latter. Inner medullary shell very small, spherical, with very
small pores.

Genus 135. _Cromyodruppa_,[174] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Druppulida# with four or more concentric shells (two
medullary and two or more cortical shells), without spines or polar tubes.

The genus _Cromyodruppa_ is characterised by the multiplication of the
concentric fenestrated shell, which is composed of two medullary shells
(enclosed in the central capsule) and two or more cortical shells (outside
it). The former may be either spherical or ellipsoidal. The latter are
always ellipsoidal, and in this it differs from _Cromyosphæra_. Probably
_Cromyodruppa_ has arisen from _Prunulum_ by secondary apposition of more
cortical envelopes.



Subgenus 1. _Cromyodruppium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Shell composed of four concentric shells, two medullary and
two cortical.


1. _Cromyodruppa cepa_, n. sp.

Shell composed of two ellipsoidal, cortical, and two spherical medullary
shells. Proportion of the main axes of the four shells = 1 : 2 : 4 : 5.
Network of all four shells nearly of the same form, subregular, with
circular pores of almost equal size in every shell. The absolute size of
the pores increases from the innermost to the outermost shell, but the
breadth of the bars does not increase in a similar degree. The bars of the
outermost shell are only twice as broad as those of the innermost; but the
pores are three to four times larger. Surface of all four shells smooth.
(The shell greatly resembles that of _Cromyatractus tetraphractus_, Pl. 15,
fig. 2, but is devoid of polar spines; it differs also in the spherical
form of both medullary shells and their relative size.)

four cortical. Proportion of their main axes = 2 : 3 : 8 : 11 : 14 : 18.
Network of the two medullary shells and of the innermost cortical shell
subregular, with subcircular pores, about the same breadth as the bars.

Genus 136. _Cromyocarpus_,[175] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Druppulida# with four or more concentric shells (two
medullary and two or more cortical shells), with numerous radial spines,
but without polar tubes.

The genus _Cromyocarpus_ differs from _Cromyodruppa_ only in the
development of numerous large radial spines which start from the outer
surface of the shell. It exhibits therefore the same relation to the latter
that _Prunocarpus_ bears to _Prunulum_, or _Druppocarpus_ to _Druppula_. It
differs from both in the multiplication of the cortical shell.

simple medullary shell, with two large opposite polar spines in the main
axis of equal size and similar form.

The genus _Lithatractus_, rich in common and widely distributed species,
begins the series of those Druppulida which are characterised by peculiar
polar spines at both poles of the main axis. It repeats the formation of
_Stylosphæra_ and _Ellipsostylus_, and differs from the former in the
ellipsoidal form of the cortical shell, from the latter in the possession
of a medullary shell. Formerly all these forms were united in the one genus
_Stylosphæra_ (see above, p. 121).

The genus _Cromyatractus_ is very nearly allied to all the foregoing
genera, which bear two equal spines opposite to one another on the poles of
the main axis; it differs {335}from them in the multiplication of the

this amphistylous series, which proceeds from _Ellipsoxiphus_ to
_Lithatractus_ and _Stylatractus_.

irregular, with large polygonal meshes, six to twelve times as broad as the
bars. Surface smooth. Polar spines strong, spindle-shaped, thorny, outside
of the sixth shell about as long as inside of it; broader than {337}the

_Definition._--#Druppulida# with simple ellipsoidal cortical shell and
simple medullary shell, with two hollow fenestrated tubes opposite on both
poles of the main axis.

The genus _Pipetta_ differs from _Pipettella_ (p. 304) in the possession of
an inner (medullary) shell; it exhibits the same tubular prolongations of
the cortical shell at both poles of the main axis.


1. _Pipetta fusus_, n. sp. (Pl. 39, figs. 8, 8_a_).

Cortical shell spindle-shaped, the middle ellipsoidal part gently passing
over on both poles into the conical tubes, which attain about the same
length. Network regular, with circular, hexagonally-framed pores, twice as
broad as the bars, sixteen to eighteen on the half equator. In the middle
part of the shell the pores arise from their hexagonal bases in the form of
short conical funnels; on both tubes they are much smaller and simple,
without frame. Medullary shell (fig. 8_a_) spherical, scarcely one-third as
broad as the cortical, with regular, circular pores, twice as broad as the
bars, eight to nine on the half equator. The two shells are connected only

2. _Pipetta tuba_, n. sp. (Pl. 39, fig. 7).

Cortical shell nearly spherical in the middle part, which is sharply
separated at both poles from the long, nearly cylindrical tubes; these are
longer than the main axis, at the distal end open (always broken off).
Network regular, with circular, hexagonally-framed pores, of the same
breadth as the bars, eighteen to twenty on the half equator. The pores of
the polar tubes are of the same shape, only much smaller, and arranged in
sixteen to eighteen longitudinal rows. Medullary shell {338}spherical,
about one-third as broad as the cortical, with simple circular pores. The
connection between the two shells is only made by two simple opposite

circular pores, three times as broad as the bars, without hexagonal frames,
fourteen to fifteen on the half equator. Pores of the polar tubes smaller,
arranged in eight to ten longitudinal rows. Medullary shell spherical,
one-fourth as broad as the cortical, connected with it by a circle of four
to six radial beams, lying in the equatorial plane. Differs from
_Pipettella prismatica_ (Pl. 39, fig. 6) in the possession of a medullary
shell and the absence of the tube edges.

_Definition._--#Druppulida# with simple ellipsoidal cortical shell and
double medullary shell, with two hollow fenestrated tubes opposite on both
poles of the main axis.

The genus _Pipettaria_ differs from the foregoing _Pipetta_ only in the
duplication of the medullary shell; as in this, the tubular prolongations
of the main axis of the cortical shell may be either conical (with closed
apex) or cylindrical (with apical opening?).


{339}1. _Pipettaria fusaria_, n. sp.

Cortical shell spindle-shaped, the middle ellipsoidal part gently passing
over on both poles into the conical tubes, which attain about half its
length. Pores regular, circular, twice as broad as the bars, sixteen to
eighteen on the half equator; pores of the tubes smaller. Both medullary
shells spheroidal, compressed. (The appearance of the cortical shell
resembles that of _Cannartiscus amphiconus_, Pl. 39, fig. 19, but without
the equatorial constriction.)

  _Cannartidium tubarium_, Haeckel, 1882, Atlas (pl. xxxix. fig. 15).

Cortical shell ellipsoidal, on both poles distinctly separated from the
short conical tubes, the length and breadth of which equal the outer
medullary shell. In the equatorial plane arises a circle of four to six
short conical protuberances, similar to the polar tubes. Pores subregular,
circular, or roundish, scarcely broader than the bars, sixteen to twenty on
the half equator. Both medullary shells spheroidal, somewhat compressed in
the direction of the two poles (as in fig. 18_a_).

Family XIII. #SPONGURIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 48, figs. 6, 7).

_Spongurida_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 447 (_sensu emendato_).

_Definition._--#Prunoidea# with spongy ellipsoidal or cylindrical shell,
composed wholly or partially of a spongy framework, without equatorial
stricture, with or without an enclosed medullary shell.

The family #Spongurida# comprises, in the sense here restricted, all those
#Prunoidea# in which the ellipsoidal or cylindrical shell is composed
wholly or partially of an irregular siliceous framework, not of simple
lattice-work. It contains two subfamilies, differing in the absence or
presence of a latticed medullary shell in the middle of the central
capsule; in the Spongellipsida it is absent, in the Spongodruppida present;
the former are most nearly related to the Ellipsida, the latter to the
Druppulida, the difference consisting only in the spongy structure of the
cortical shell.

In my Monograph (1862, p. 447) the family Spongurida had a much wider
extent, comprising also a number of #Sphæroidea# and #Discoidea#, agreeing
in the spongy {340}structure of the shell. Here we restrict the definition
to those spongy #Sphærellaria# in which the central capsule and the
enclosing spongy cortical shell are ellipsoidal or cylindrical, therefore
each transverse section is a circle, and each meridional section an
ellipse, as in all #Prunoidea#.

_The Cortical Shell_ in all Spongurida is composed of a delicate framework
of irregularly branched and interwoven siliceous threads; commonly this
spongy structure is rather dense or compact, but sometimes also very loose.
In the simplest form, _Spongellipsis_, the spongy cortical shell contains a
large cavity, in which lies freely the central capsule. In _Spongurus_ this
cavity is completely distended by a spongy framework. In this case the
solid spongy shell becomes often prolonged, and its original ellipsoidal
form passes over into a cylindrical one (as in many Zygartida). Sometimes
(particularly in _Spongocore_, Pl. 48, fig. 6) the cylinder becomes
three-jointed by two more or less distinct annular constrictions.
_Spongocore_ is distinguished by an outer veil, a thin lattice-lamella,
which envelops the spongy shell and is connected with it by radial beams.

_The Medullary Shell_, absent in the Spongellipsida, is constant in the
second subfamily Spongodruppida. It is either a simple latticed shell
(_Spongodruppa_) or double, composed of two concentric latticed shells
(_Spongoliva_); its form is either spherical or ellipsoidal. It lies in the
middle of the central capsule, and is connected by radial beams
(perforating the membrane of the latter) with the enveloping spongy
cortical shell.

In many Spongurida the surface of the shell is armed with radial spines,
and in some genera (_Spongoprunum_, _Spongatractus_, &c., Pl. 17, fig. 12),
on both poles of the main axis, are developed two strong opposite polar
spines, as in many other #Prunoidea#.

_The Central Capsule_ of the Spongurida is either ellipsoidal or
cylindrical. Only in _Spongellipsis_ it lies freely in the internal cavity
of the spongy shell. In all other genera it is perforated by a part of the
skeleton; in the Spongodruppida it contains the simple or double medullary
shell, and the radial beams which perforate its membrane and connect the
latter with the external spongy cortical shell. In _Spongurus_ and the
allied genera (_Spongocore_, _Spongoprunum_) the whole central capsule is
filled with a spongy framework which also envelops its surface.

_Spongolarcus_ among the #Larcoidea#. In some species the ellipsoidal form
is prolonged and passes into a cylindrical one.

The genus _Spongurus_ was founded by me in 1862 for the common cosmopolitan
_Spongurus cylindricus_, a massive spongy cylinder with radial spines. I
enlarge here the conception of the genus, in receiving also ellipsoidal,
massive spongy #Prunoidea#, with or without radial spines. Sometimes the
cylindrical shell is more or less distinctly three-jointed, with two
annular strictures, as also in the following and nearly allied genus.

Genus 146. _Spongocore_,[185] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Spongurida# with ellipsoidal or cylindrical (sometimes
three-jointed) shell of solid spongy framework, without internal cavity and
without latticed medullary shell. Polar spines absent. An outer
lattice-mantle is connected with the spongy shell by radial beams.

The genus _Spongocore_ contains some widely distributed Spongurida, which
are distinguished from the nearly related _Spongurus_ by the development of
a peculiar veil or mantle of delicate lattice-work, which envelops either
the whole shell or only the middle part of it, and is connected with it by
numerous radial beams. The distance of the simple fine lattice-lamella from
the spongy shell is everywhere the same. Often the cylindrical shell is
three-jointed, with two annular strictures, as also in the foregoing
_Spongurus._ It is derived from the latter by development of the veil
connecting the points of the radial spines.



Subgenus 1. _Spongocorina_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Shell without distinct annular strictures, not evidently
three-jointed.

Genus 147. _Spongoprunum_,[186] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Spongurida# with ellipsoidal or cylindrical shell of solid
spongy framework, without internal cavity and without latticed medullary
shell. On the poles of the axis occur two opposite strong spines.

The genus _Spongoprunum_ differs from the most nearly allied _Spongurus_ by
the possession of two strong solid spines, lying in the axis of the
ellipsoidal or cylindrical massive spongy shell, on its two opposite poles.
_Spongoprunum_ bears therefore the same relation to _Spongurus_ that
_Ellipsoxiphus_ does to _Cenellipsis_.

Shell ellipsoidal, two and a third times as long as broad, with nearly
smooth surface. Spongy framework very compact, in the whole solid shell of
the same structure, with very small meshes, {348}scarcely broader than the

Subfamily SPONGODRUPPIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Spongurida# with latticed medullary shell, enclosed by a
spongy cortical shell.



Genus 148. _Spongodruppa_,[187] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Spongurida# with spongy ellipsoidal cortical shell,
enclosing a simple, spherical or ellipsoidal, latticed medullary shell.
Polar spines absent.

The genus _Spongodruppa_ opens the series of Spongodruppida, or of those
Spongurida in which the ellipsoidal spongy cortical shell encloses a simple
or double, latticed, medullary shell. In _Spongodruppa_, the simplest and
probably the ancestral form of this subfamily, the medullary shell is
simple and the polar spines absent. It may be derived from _Druppula_ by a
spongy thickening of the simple latticed cortical shell.

Genus 149. _Spongatractus_,[188] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Spongurida# with spongy ellipsoidal cortical shell,
enclosing a simple, spherical or ellipsoidal, latticed medullary shell. On
the poles of the axis occur two opposite strong spines.

The genus _Spongatractus_ differs from _Spongodruppa_ by development of two
strong spines in the axis of the shell, on its two opposite poles;
therefore it bears the same relation to the latter that _Lithatractus_ does
to _Druppula_, and can be derived from _Lithatractus_ by a spongy
thickening of the cortical shell.

_Definition._--#Spongurida# with spongy ellipsoidal cortical shell,
enclosing a double, spherical or ellipsoidal, latticed medullary shell.
Polar spines absent.

The genus _Spongoliva_ differs from the nearest _Spongodruppa_ by
duplication of the medullary shell; it bears therefore the same relation to
this that _Prunulum_ does to _Druppula_, and can be regarded as a
_Prunulum_, in which the simple latticed cortical shell is replaced by a
spongy framework.

Cortical shell one and a third times as long as broad, armed with numerous
thin, bristle-shaped, radial spines, nearly as long as the shell. Spongy

Genus 151. _Spongoxiphus_,[190] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Spongurida# with spongy ellipsoidal cortical shell,
enclosing a double, spherical or ellipsoidal, latticed medullary shell. On
the poles of the axis occur two opposite strong spines.

The genus _Spongoxiphus_ differs from _Spongoliva_ by the development of
two strong spines in the axis of the shell, on its two opposite poles. From
the similar _Spongatractus_ it differs in the duplication of the medullary
shell. It may also be regarded as a _Stylatractus_, in which the simple
latticed cortical shell is replaced by an irregular spongy framework.


1. _Spongoxiphus sphærococcus_, n. sp.

Cortical shell one and a half times as long as broad, with thorny surface.
Spongy framework compact, with small meshes, its thickness equal to the
radius of the outer medullary shell. Both medullary shells spherical, the
outer three times as broad as the inner. Polar spines very stout, conical,
slightly sulcated, about half as long as the cortical shell, as broad at
the base as the outer medullary shell. (Differs from _Spongatractus
pachystylus_ almost only in the double medullary shell.)

of the spongy wall 0.025; diameter of the outer medullary shell 0.05, of

Spongy framework very compact, with very small meshes, its thickness about
equals the breadth of the outer medullary shell. Both medullary shells
ellipsoidal, the outer three times as large as the inner. Polar spines very
stout, three-sided pyramidal, about half as long as the cortical shell, on
the base about as broad as the outer medullary shell. (Differs from the
preceding in the ellipsoidal form of both medullary shells, and in the
finer structure of the spongy framework.)

_Dimensions._--Length of the cortical shell 0.18 to 0.2, breadth 0.14 to
0.16; thickness of the spongy wall 0.035 to 0.04; length of the outer

Family XIV. #ARTISCIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 39, figs. 9, 10; Pl. 48, fig. 5).

_Artiscida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 462.

_Definition._--#Prunoidea# with an ellipsoidal twin-shell divided by an
equatorial stricture into two communicating hemiellipsoidal or
hemispherical chambers, without enclosed medullary shell. Central capsule
ellipsoidal, with or without equatorial stricture.

The family #Artiscida# has a simple fenestrated outer shell, like that of
the Ellipsida, but differs from these in the presence of an equatorial
constriction, by which it assumes a characteristic twin form, somewhat
similar to a violin (Pl. 39, figs. 9, 10). From the Cyphinida, which have
the same form of the cortical shell, the Artiscida differ in the absence of
the medullary shell. It is possible that the Artiscida are descended from
the Cyphinida (by loss of the medullary shell), but it is more probable
that they arise from the Ellipsida by an annular constriction in the
equatorial plane (perhaps the formation of the shell originally took place
while the central capsule was undergoing division). Both halves of the twin
shell are always of the same size and form. Its outer surface is either
smooth or covered with radial spines (_Artiscus_, Pl. 39, fig. 9).
Sometimes on the opposite poles of the main axis are developed solid spines
(_Stylartus_, Pl. 48, fig. 5) or hollow fenestrated tubes (_Cannartus_, Pl.
39, fig. 10).

_The Central Capsule_ is either simply ellipsoidal, or has also an
equatorial constriction, which divides it into two equal halves. It is
constantly smaller than the surrounding shell, and separated from its inner
surface by a thicker or thinner jelly-mantle, the calymma.

_Synopsis of the Genera of Artiscida._

  On the poles of the main axis neither solid spines
    nor hollow tubes,                                     152. _Artiscus_.

  On the poles of the main axis two solid spines (or

{355}Genus 152. _Artiscus_,[191] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 462.

_Definition._--#Artiscida# without peculiar polar appendages (without
strong solid spines or hollow fenestrated tubes on the poles of the main
axis).

The genus _Artiscus_ represents the most simple and primitive form of the
Artiscida, and may therefore be regarded as the ancestral form of this
subfamily. It resembles an ordinary double loaf, composed of two equal,
nearly ellipsoidal fenestrated shells separated by the stricture in the
equatorial plane. _Artiscus_ can be derived from _Cenellipsis_ simply by
this equatorial constriction. But it can also be derived from _Cyphanta_ by
loss of the medullary shell.

0.004; spines 0.015 long.

6. _Artiscus nodosus_, n. sp. (Pl. 39, fig. 9).

Pores of the shell subregular, circular, without hexagonal frame, three
times as broad as the bars; sixteen to eighteen on the half meridian, ten
to twelve on the half equator. Irregularly scattered on the whole surface a
variable number (twenty-five to thirty in all) of stout short radial spines
or rather blunt rods; the length and thickness of these is the same, and
equals the size of two to three meshes; its form resembles a truncated

0.003; length and thickness of the radial sticks 0.02.

Pores of the shell irregular, roundish, of very unequal size and dissimilar
form, twice to eight times as broad as the bars; ten to fifteen on the half
meridian, seven to nine on the half equator. Irregularly scattered on the
whole surface a large number of thin conical spines, about as large as the
meshes, partly directed radially, partly obliquely. (The shell of this
species resembles very much that of _Cyphonium ceratospyris_ (p. 366) =
_Didymocyrtis ceratospyris_, Monogr. d. Radiol., 1862, Taf. xxii. fig. 14,
but is without the enclosed inner shells.)

{357}_Dimensions._--Main axis 0.12, equatorial axis 0.07; meshes 0.004 to
0.02, bars 0.002 to 0.005; spines 0.01 to 0.02.

Genus 153. _Stylartus_,[192] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 462.

_Definition._--#Artiscida# with two strong, solid, polar spines, or two
bunches of polar spines, opposite on the two poles of the main axis.

The genus _Stylartus_ differs from _Artiscus_ by the production of two
large opposite spines in the main axis, starting from both poles of it;
sometimes every spine is surrounded by a group of smaller radial spines.
The genus is nearly allied to _Ellipsoxiphus_ (p. 295), and differs from it
only in the equatorial stricture of the ellipsoidal shell. But it may also
be derived from the similar _Cyphinus_ (Pl. 39, fig. 14) by loss of the
medullary shell.



Subgenus 1. _Stylartella_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--On each pole of the main axis only one single large spine.


1. _Stylartus bipolaris_, n. sp. (Pl. 48, fig. 5).

Shell thick walled, rough; both its chambers nearly spherical, with
irregular, roundish pores, twice to four times as broad as the bars; eight
to ten on the half equator of each chamber. Polar spines very strong,
conical, as long as the greatest breadth.

_Dimensions._--Length of the shell (without spines) 0.18, greatest breadth
0.13; length of the polar spines 0.13, basal breadth 0.03.

_Habitat._--Western Tropical Pacific, Station 224, depth 1850 fathoms.


2. _Stylartus bicuspis_, n. sp.

Shell thin walled, smooth, with regular, circular pores, twice as broad as
the bars; twelve to fourteen on the half equator of each chamber. Polar
spines very stout, straight, three-sided pyramidal, half as long as the
shell.

_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.16, greatest breadth 0.12; length of
the polar spines 0.08, basal thickness 0.025.

Subgenus 2. _Stylartura_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--On each pole of the main axis a bunch of several spines.


{358}3. _Stylartus palatus_, n. sp.

Shell thick walled, thorny, with irregular, roundish pores, twice to three
times as broad as the bars; fifteen to eighteen on the half equator of each
chamber. On each pole of the main axis a large conical spine, surrounded by
a group of ten to fifteen smaller spines, one-third to two-thirds as long
as the breadth of the deep equatorial stricture.

_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.14, greatest breadth 0.09; length of
the polar spines 0.03 to 0.06, basal breadth 0.005 to 0.015.

chamber. On each pole of the main axis a brush-like bunch of twenty to
thirty thin conical radial spines, half as long as the shell.

_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.15, greatest breadth 0.1; length of
the polar spines 0.08, basal breadth 0.005.

_Habitat._--Equatorial Atlantic, Station 347, surface.



Genus 154. _Cannartus_,[193] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 462.

_Definition._--#Artiscida# with two hollow polar tubes (fenestrated
cylindrical or conical tubuli, opposite on the two poles of the main axis).

The genus _Cannartus_ differs from _Artiscus_ by the production of two
opposite hollow tubes on both poles of the main axis. The cavity of the
conical or cylindrical fenestrated tubes communicates freely with that of
the shell; the network in both is the same. The distal end of the tubes is
nearly always broken off, sometimes closed, with a conical apex.
_Cannartus_ can be derived either from _Pipettella_ by a transverse
equatorial constriction, or from _Cannartiscus_ by the loss of the
medullary shell, or from _Artiscus_ by the production of the polar tubes.


1. _Cannartus violina_, n. sp. (Pl. 39, fig. 10).

Pores of the shell subregular, circular, twice to three times as broad as
the bars; eighteen to twenty on the half meridian, fourteen to sixteen on
the half equator. Shell-wall in the "tropical zone" of both halves
thickened. Polar tubes nearly cylindrical, about as long as the main axis,
distal ends broken off.

_Dimensions._--Main axis 0.14, equatorial axis 0.09; meshes 0.008, bars
0.003; length of the polar tubes 0.12, breadth 0.02 to 0.03.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 268, depth 2900 fathoms.


{359}2. _Cannartus bitubulus_, n. sp.

Pores of the shell regular, circular, hexagonally framed, of the same
breadth as the bars; fourteen to sixteen on the half meridian, ten to
twelve on the half equator. Polar tubes cylindrical, longer than the main
axis, sulcated, distal ends broken off. (Similar to _Pipetta tuba_, Pl. 39,
fig. 7, but with equatorial stricture and without medullary shell.)

_Dimensions._--Main axis 0.16, equatorial axis 0.12; meshes and bars 0.006;
length of the polar tubes 0.2, breadth 0.025.

3. _Cannartus biscottus_, n. sp.

Pores of the shell irregular, roundish, twice to three times as broad as
the bars; ten to twelve on the half meridian, six to eight on the half
equator.  Polar tubes conical, shorter than the main axis, with closed
apex. (Similar to _Cannartidium bicinctum_, Pl. 39, fig. 18, but without
enclosed medullary shell.)

_Dimensions._--Main axis 0.11, equatorial axis 0.07; meshes 0.005 to 0.01,
bars 0.003; length of the polar tubes 0.08, breadth on the base 0.03.

_Habitat._--Equatorial Atlantic, Station 348, depth 2450 fathoms.



Family XV. #CYPHINIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 39, figs. 11-19).

_Cyphinida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 462.

_Definition._--#Prunoidea# with ellipsoidal twin-shell, divided by an
equatorial stricture into two communicating hemiellipsoidal or
hemispherical chambers; this external twin-shell (cortical shell) is either
simple or double, and encloses one or more internal concentric shells
(medullary shells).  Central capsule ellipsoidal, commonly with an
equatorial constriction.

The family #Cyphinida# have the same characteristic twin-form of the
cortical shell as the Artiscida, but differ from them in the presence of a
simple or double internal medullary shell, connected with the cortical
shell by radial beams.  The fenestrated shell is therefore composed of two
or more concentric shells as in the Druppulida, but differs from these in
the ring-like equatorial constriction.

_The Medullary Shell_, in the middle of the central capsule, is either
single or double, composed of two concentric shells.  As in the Druppulida,
the form of the medullary shells is either spherical (Pl. 39, fig. 12_a_)
or lenticular, compressed from both poles of the main axis (Pl. 39, fig.
18_a_); sometimes the inner medullary shell is spherical, the outer
lenticular.

_The Radial Beams_, which connect the medullary shell with the equatorial
constriction of the cortical shell, lie either all in the equatorial plane
(Pl. 39, fig. 11) or near it on both sides (Pl. 39, figs. 12_a_, 18_a_).

{360}The _Cortical Shell_ is commonly simple (Pl. 39, figs. 12, 18),
sometimes composed of two concentric shells (Pl. 39, fig. 13), rarely of
three. As in the Artiscida, also in the Cyphinida, from both poles of the
main axis solid spines or hollow fenestrated tubes are often developed (Pl.
39, figs. 14, 16-18).

_The Central Capsule_ of the Cyphinida (Pl. 39, fig. 13) is of the same
form as in the Artiscida, generally ellipsoidal, but with an equatorial
ring-like stricture, which divides it into two equal halves. It encloses
the simple or double medullary shell, and is perforated by the radial beams
starting from this. From the inner surface of the surrounding cortical
shell it is separated by a thicker or thinner jelly-layer, the calymma.

Genus 155. _Cyphanta_,[194] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Cyphinida# with simple cortical shell and simple medullary
shell, without polar spines or tubes.

The genus _Cyphanta_ is the most simple of all Cyphinida, and can be
regarded as the common ancestral form of this family. It may be derived
phylogenetically from _Druppula_ by a ring-like constriction in the
equatorial plane of the ellipsoidal cortical shell, or from _Artiscus_ by
secondary formation of a central (spherical or ellipsoidal) medullary
shell.

_Definition._--Surface of the cortical shell smooth, without spines or
thorns.

hexagonal, three to four times as broad as the bars; ten to twelve on the
half meridian, seven to eight on the half equator. Medullary shell
spherical, its diameter one-third of the equatorial axis of the cortical
shell. (The cortical shell of this species is nearly identical with the

Genus 156. _Cyphonium_,[195] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Cyphinida# with simple cortical shell and double medullary
shell, without polar spines or tubes.

The genus _Cyphonium_ contains a number of very common species, among which
are the earliest known forms of this family, partly described by Ehrenberg
as Ommatospyris {363}(which genus contains also a number of other
#Prunoidea#), partly by me (1862) as _Didymocyrtis_. Both names are
inadequate, as allusions to quite different families of Nassellaria, but
may be retained as significations of subgeneric divisions. _Cyphonium_
differs from _Cyphanta_ by the double medullary shell, which is either
spherical or lenticular.

Genus 157. _Cypassis_,[196] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Cyphinida# with double cortical shell and double medullary
shell, without polar spines or tubes.

The genus _Cypassis_ differs from _Cyphonium_ by duplication of the
cortical twin-shell; from the outer surface of the simple twin-shell arise
numerous radial spines, which become connected by anastomosing transverse
branches, and in this manner form an outer envelope or mantle. _Cypassis_
may also be regarded as a _Cromyodruppa_, the double cortical shell of
which is constricted in the equatorial plane.

_Definition._--#Cyphinida# with triple cortical shell and double medullary
shell, without polar spines or tubes.

The genus _Cyphocolpus_ differs from both foregoing genera by the increased

double in _Cypassis_, they are triple in _Cyphocolpus_, composed of three
concentric envelopes. The three genera named represent a phylogenetic
series, which is repeated in the ontogenetic development of _Cyphocolpus_.

bars; five to six on the half meridian of each chamber, eight to ten on its
half equator. Middle cortical shell also with subregular, circular pores of
the same size. Outer cortical shell with smooth surface, with more
irregular, roundish pores of very different size. The distance between
every two shells equals the diameter of the inner medullary shell, which,
like the outer, is spheroidal.

attains more than the diameter of the outer medullary shell, which, like
the inner, is spheroidal, slightly compressed.

_Dimensions._--Main axis of the outer cortical shell 0.26, of the middle
0.22, of the inner 0.14; greatest breadth of the inner cortical shell 0.09,

The genus _Cyphinus_ differs from _Cyphanta_ by the development of two
opposite spines (or bunches of spines) on both poles of the main axis. It
simulates therefore the bipolar formation of _Stylartus_, and differs from
this in the possession of a medullary shell.

half meridian of each chamber, nine to ten on its half equator. Around both
poles of the main axis a polar circle of eight to ten divergent radial

{371}Genus 160. _Cyphinidium_,[199] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Cyphinida# with simple cortical shell and double medullary
shell, with two opposite polar spines (or bunches of polar spines) on the
poles of the main axis.

The genus _Cyphinidium_ differs from _Cyphinus_ only in the duplication of
the medullary shell, which is composed of two concentric spheres or
somewhat compressed lenticular spheroids. It exhibits therefore the same
relation to _Cyphinus_ that _Stylatractus_ in the Druppulida bears to
_Lithatractus_. Possibly the two former genera are derived from the two
latter by an annular constriction in the equatorial plane.



Subgenus 1. _Cyphinidoma_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--On both poles of the cortical shell one single polar spine
or a bunch of polar spines.


1. _Cyphinidium amphistylium_, n. sp.

Cortical shell thick walled, with smooth surface, and subregular, circular
pores, twice to three times as broad as the bars; eight to ten on the half
meridian, sixteen to eighteen on the half equator of each chamber. Both
medullary shells spherical. The cortical shell resembles very much that of
_Cannartiscus amphiconiscus_ (Pl. 39, fig. 19), but exhibits instead of the
hollow polar tubes two strong solid polar spines of conical form, half as
long as the main axis, and as broad at the base as the inner medullary
shell.

_Dimensions._--Main axis of the cortical shell (without polar spines) 0.14,
greatest breadth 0.1; pores 0.008, bars 0.004; length of the polar spines

  d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 317.

Cortical shell thin walled, with thorny surface, and irregular, polygonal
pores, three to five times as broad as the thin bars; eight to nine on the
half meridian, thirteen to fifteen on the half equator of each chamber. On
both poles a bunch of four to eight strong conical spines, the central of
which (in the main axis) is much larger than the others, and twice as long
as the diameter of the outer spheroidal medullary shell; size and number of
the polar spines is very variable (commonly five to six).

{372}_Dimensions._--Main axis (without spines) 0.12, greatest breadth 0.08;
pores 0.005 to 0.01, bars 0.002; length of the polar spines 0.02 to 0.06,

four times as broad as the bars; seven to eight on the half meridian,
eleven to thirteen on the half equator of each chamber. Around both poles
of the main axis occurs a circle of ten to twelve strong, radially
divergent spines, about as long as the diameter of the outer medullary
shell, which, like the inner, is spheroidal. (This species is identical
with the younger developmental stage of _Panicium coronatum_, Pl. 40, fig.
4, before the formation of two distal chambers.)

_Dimensions._--Main axis 0.12, greatest breadth 0.1; pores 0.008 to 0.016,
bars 0.004; length of the polar spines 0.02, thickness 0.005.

_Definition._--#Cyphinida# with simple cortical shell and simple medullary
shell, with two hollow fenestrated polar tubes, opposite on both poles of
the main axis.

The genus _Cannartiscus_ differs from _Cyphanta_ in the development of two
hollow fenestrated tubes, opposite on both poles of the main axis. It
simulates therefore the characteristic formation of _Cannartus_, and
differs from this Artiscid in the possession of a medullary shell.


1. _Cannartiscus amphiconiscus_, n. sp. (Pl. 39, fig. 19).

  _Cannartidium amphiconiscus_, Haeckel, 1882, Atlas (pl. xxxix. fig. 19).

Cortical shell thick walled, smooth, with regular, circular pores, twice as
broad as the bars; nine to ten on the half meridian, sixteen to eighteen on
the half equator of each chamber. Polar tubes conical, about as long as one
single chamber, on the base somewhat broader than the simple spherical
medullary shell. Pores of the tubes only one-third as great as those of the
chambers.

Cortical shell thick walled, rough, with subregular, circular pores, twice
to four times as broad as the bars; six to seven on the half meridian, ten
to twelve on the half equator of each chamber. Polar tubes cylindrical, on
the distal end open (broken off?) nearly as long as the main axis, somewhat
narrower than the spherical medullary shell. Pores of the tubes much
smaller than those of the chambers.

_Dimensions._--Main axis (without tubes) 0.17, greatest breadth 0.12; pores
0.006 to 0.012, bars 0.003. Length of the polar tubes 0.15, breadth of them
0.03; pores 0.003, bars 0.002.

occurs fossil in the rocks of Barbados.



Genus 162. _Cannartidium_,[201] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Cyphinida# with simple cortical shell and double medullary
shell, with two hollow fenestrated polar tubes, opposite on both poles of
the main axis.

The genus _Cannartidium_ differs from _Cannartiscus_ and _Cannartus_ in the
duplication of the medullary shell, which is composed of two concentric
spheres or compressed lenticular spheroids. The three genera named form
therefore one morphological series, with identical cortical shell, and only
differing in the absence or presence of a simple or double medullary shell.

_Definition._--Surface of the cortical shell smooth or a little rough, but
without spines or fenestrated protuberances.

Cortical shell thick walled, smooth with regular circular pores twice as
broad as the bars; eight to nine on the half meridian, fifteen to sixteen
on the half equator of each chamber. Polar tubes conical, with smaller
pores, tapering towards the closed apex, about as long as one single
chamber, at the base one-third as broad as the equatorial constriction.
Both concentric medullary shells spherical. (Nearly identical with
_Cannartiscus amphiconiscus_, Pl. 39, fig. 19, but differs in the
possession of the double medullary shell.)

Cortical shell thick walled, rough, with irregular, roundish pores, twice
to five times as broad as the bars; five to six on the half meridian, nine
to ten on the half equator of each chamber. Polar tubes conical, with
smaller pores, about as long as one single chamber, half as broad at the
base as the equatorial constriction. (This deep-sea form is probably
identical with that fossil species which Ehrenberg, in 1844, described as
_Haliomma amphisiphon_, and which he afterwards, in 1875, erroneously
identified with his _Astromma entomocora_ (= _Cypassis entomocora_). But
the figure given of the latter is quite different from the given diagnosis
of the former.)

5. _Cannartidium mammiferum_, n. sp. (Pl. 39, fig. 16).

Cortical shell-thin walled, having a circle of six to eight conical
protuberances in the greatest breadth of both chambers, each of which
exhibits a central apical pore, surrounded by a circle of six to eight
oblique larger pores. Between the protuberances occur nine to ten pores on
the half meridian of each chamber, circular, subregular, twice to three

Cortical shell thin walled, of the same form and structure as in the
foregoing species, differs from this mainly in the form of the polar tubes,
which are not cylindrical but conical, tapering gradually from the base
towards the closed apex. Besides this, the conical protuberances (six in
the greatest periphery of each chamber) are more regular and acute, with
smaller and more numerous pores. Both medullary shells are here also
spherical.

_Dimensions._--Main axis (without tubes) 0.14, greatest breadth (including
the protuberances) 0.13; pores 0.006 to 0.009, bars 0.004; length of the
polar tubes 0.07, basal thickness 0.03.

Family XVI. #PANARTIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 40, figs. 1-9).

_Definition._--#Prunoidea# with a four-jointed cortical shell, the external
shell being divided by three parallel transverse constrictions into four
chambers, in the centre enclosing two internal concentric shells (medullary
shells). Central capsule cylindrical, commonly four-jointed (with three
transverse annular constrictions).

The family #Panartida# (Pl. 40, figs. 1-9) is characterised by its
four-jointed cortical shell, constantly composed of four chambers, lying
one behind another in the elongated main axis. They are separated by three
ring-like constrictions lying in three parallel transverse planes; the
middle of these is the equatorial plane. In the centre of this latter lies
constantly a double medullary shell.

The Panartida must be derived from the Cyphinida by further increase in the
longitudinal or main axis, and by repetition of the equatorial constriction
in two transverse planes parallel to it and at an equal distance from it.

{376}_The Medullary Shell_ is always double in this family, composed of two
small concentric shells lying in the middle of the central capsule. They
are either spherical or lenticular, compressed towards both poles of the
main axis; sometimes the inner is spherical, the outer lenticular. From the
equatorial circumference of the latter starts a number of radial beams,
which perforate the central capsule, and are inserted into the equatorial
constriction of the cortical shell. Commonly all radial beams lie in the
equatorial plane, sometimes also a part of them on both sides of it.

_The Cortical Shell_ is constantly composed of four completely latticed
chambers, which are only separated by the three annular constrictions. In
many species all four chambers have the same form and size (Pl. 40, fig.
3), but in the greater number of species both proximal (or central)
chambers are different in size, shape, or structure from both distal (or
polar) chambers. The cortical shell is either simple or double, composed of
two concentric four-jointed shells; rarely it is triple or multiple,
composed of three or more shells fitting one inside the other. Very often
the outer cortical shell is incomplete, and only developed around the two
proximal chambers of the complete inner cortical shell, both distal
chambers of the latter remaining simple.

On both poles of the main axis often are developed solid spines
(_Panicium_, Pl. 40, fig. 4) or hollow fenestrated tubes (_Panarium_, Pl.
40, fig. 9), as in the foregoing families. Besides this, the surface of the
cortical shell may be armed with spines.

_The Central Capsule_ of the Panartida is always cylindrical, on both poles
hemispherical; commonly it is more or less distinctly four-jointed, with
three ring-like constrictions corresponding to those of the enclosing
cortical shell. From the inner surface of the latter it is separated by a
thinner or thicker jelly-mantle.

Genus 163. _Panartus_,[202] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Panartida# with simple cortical shell and double medullary
shell, without polar spines or tubes on both poles of the main axis.

{377}The genus _Panartus_ represents the common ancestral form of all
Panartida, as all other genera of this subfamily must be derived from it
and are only further developmental stages, from an ontogenetic as well as
from a phylogenetic point of view. The cortical shell of _Panartus_ is
constantly composed of four fenestrated chambers jointed to one another in
the main axis; both proximal chambers are separated from one another by the
equatorial ring-like constriction, in the centre of which lies the double
medullary shell; both distal chambers are separated from the former by two
other annular constrictions (in planes parallel to the equatorial plane).
All four chambers may exhibit the same (kidney-shaped) form and structure
(in the subgenera _Panartella_ and _Panartoma_); or the proximal chamber
may differ more or less in shape and size from the distal (in the subgenera
_Panartissa_ and _Panartura_). The outer surface of the cortical shell is
sometimes smooth (as in _Panartella_ and _Panartissa_), at other times
spiny or thorny (as in _Panartoma_ and _Panartura_). The double medullary
shell is sometimes spherical, or commonly compressed at both poles and
spheroidal or lenticular.

compressed; the outer half as broad as the constriction. (This species is
very much like _Ommatocampe increscens_, Stöhr, 1880, _loc. cit._, Taf. ii.
fig. 2, and may be considered as the ancestral form of it.)

structure, kidney-shaped, twice as broad as long. Pores rather regular,
circular, with hexagonal frames, twice to three times as broad as the bars;

distal chambers.


13. _Panartus spinosus_, n. sp.

Both proximal chambers nearly ellipsoidal, with regular, circular pores
enclosed by hexagonal frames. Both distal chambers conical, with a circle
of ten to twelve large square pores at the base; the other pores small,
roundish. The cortical shell of this species is quite the same as that of

external envelope (or the second cortical shell), and is covered with
short, conical spines on the whole surface.

distal chambers. Meshes of the cortical shell irregular, polygonal, or
subregular hexagonal; at the base of each {382}distal chamber a circle of
large square meshes. The breadth of the pores is eight to twelve times that

15. _Panartus pluteus_, n. sp. (Pl. 40, fig. 2).

Both proximal chambers kidney-shaped, with irregular, roundish pores, twice
to four times as broad as the bars; their surface everywhere covered with
short conical thorns. From both polar circles arise ten to twelve radial
rods, which bear a fenestrated cap, and form thus either the beginning of a
second, external, cortical shell, or (if remaining thus) two imperfect
distal chambers. The spherical segment, which forms their surface, is
concentric with the proximal chambers, is perforated by the same irregular,
roundish pores, and covered with numerous bristle-like spines.

_Dimensions._--Main axis of the cortical shell 0.17, equatorial axis (in
the constriction) 0.06; distance between the proximal and distal chambers
0.03; pores 0.003 to 0.01, bars 0.003 to 0.005.

Genus 164. _Peripanartus_,[203] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Panartida# with double cortical shell and double medullary
shell, without polar spines or tubes on both poles of the main axis.

The genus _Peripanartus_ differs from _Panartus_ only in the development of
an outer reticulated envelop, which mantle-like surrounds the shell and
represents a second or external cortical shell. This mantle or veil
envelops either the whole internal cortical shell or only both proximal
chambers. _Peripanartus_ exhibits the same relation to _Panartus_ as in the
foregoing ancestral family _Cypassis_ bears to _Cyphonium_.



Subgenus 1. _Peripanartula_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Surface of the outer cortical shell smooth, without spines
or thorns.


1. _Peripanartus palliatus_, n. sp.

Internal cortical shell with four kidney-shaped chambers of equal size and
similar form, identical with the cortical shell of _Panartus tetrathalamus_
and _Panartus quadrijugus_ (Pl. 40, fig. 3), with irregular, roundish
pores, twice to three times as broad as the bars. It differs from these two
species {383}only by the external cortical shell enveloping the whole
internal one, in the same manner as in _Peripanartus cylindrus_ (Pl. 40,
fig. 6). The two shells are connected by numerous radial rods. The surface
of the outer cortical shell is quite smooth, its irregular, roundish pores
about half as large as those of the inner cortical shell.

_Dimensions._--Main axis of the external cortical shell 0.27, of the
internal 0.2; greatest breadth of the former (in the equator of each
chamber) 0.13, of the latter 0.09; pores of the external cortical shell
0.002 to 0.004, of the internal 0.004 to 0.008; bars of the former 0.002,
of the latter 0.003.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Stations 271, 272, depth 2425 to 2600
fathoms.


2. _Peripanartus lævigatus_, n. sp.

Internal cortical shell with four unequal chambers, both proximal
kidney-shaped (with subregular polygonal pores, twice to three times as
broad as the bars), both distal nearly hemispherical, with subregular,
roundish pores of half that size. External cortical shell envelops only the
proximal chambers, and appears as the direct continuation of the internal
shell of the distal chambers, with the same small roundish pores. The outer
surface is quite smooth. This species has nearly the same structure as
_Peripanicium amphicorona_ (Pl. 40, fig. 8), but differs from it by the
absence of the polar spine-circles, and by the perfect smoothness of the
surface.

_Dimensions._--Main axis of the shell 0.25, greatest breadth (in the
equator of the proximal chambers) 0.15; equatorial stricture of the
external shell 0.10, of the internal 0.07; pores of the internal shell of
the proximal chambers 0.013, of the external 0.006; bars 0.003.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 274, depth 2750 fathoms.


3. _Peripanartus amphiconus_, n. sp. (Pl. 40, fig. 5).

Inner cortical shell with four very unequal chambers; both proximal
chambers kidney-shaped (with regular, circular, hexagonally framed pores,
twice as broad as the bars); both distal chambers conical, with a circle of
large square pores at the base, the other pores very small, roundish.
Outer cortical shell very thin, quite smooth, with irregular, roundish
pores, envelops in younger specimens only the distal chambers. But the
radial spines on the surface of the internal cortical shell of the proximal
chambers indicate that these will also be afterwards enclosed by the
growing of the external shell. This species exhibits the progressive
(ontogenetic as well as phylogenetic) development of _Panartus amphiconus_.

_Dimensions._--Main axis of the outer cortical shell 0.3, its greatest
breadth (at the prominent distal ends of the radial rods between the large
square pores) 0.15; pores 0.003 to 0.001, bars 0.005; main axis of the
inner cortical shell 0.26, its greatest breadth 0.13; pores of its distal
chambers 0.003, of its proximal chambers 0.01; large square pores 0.03;
bars 0.004.

thorns.


4. _Peripanartus atractus_, n. sp. (Pl. 40, fig. 7).

Inner cortical shell with four very unequal chambers; both proximal
chambers spheroidal (with subregular, roundish pores, twice to three times
as broad as the bars), both distal chambers nearly conical, with a circle
of eight to ten very large square pores at the base; the other pores very
small, roundish. Outer cortical shell envelops only the proximal chambers
and the basal half of the distal chambers, appearing as the direct
continuation of the microporous covering of their apical half. The whole
external cortical shell is inflated in the equatorial zone, and hence
assumes an irregular, spindle-like appearance. Its whole surface is rough
with innumerable very short thorns.

_Dimensions._--Main axis 0.28, equatorial axis 0.17; pores of the external
cortical shell 0.002 to 0.004, bars 0.002; main axis of the proximal
chambers of the internal cortical shell 0.07, equatorial axis 0.09; pores
0.007, bars 0.004.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 244, depth 2900 fathoms.


5. _Peripanartus cylindrus_, n. sp. (Pl. 40, fig. 6).

Internal cortical shell with four unequal chambers; both proximal chambers
kidney-shaped (with regular, circular, hexagonally framed pores of the same
breadth as the bars), both distal chambers nearly hemispherical, with a
circle of eight to ten very large square pores at their base; the other
pores very small, roundish. External cortical shell envelops the whole
internal like a perfect hollow cylinder, which is closed at both poles by a
hemispherical cap. The whole surface of this cylindrical mantle is
perforated by innumerable very small roundish pores, and covered with small
bristle-like spines.

_Dimensions._--Main axis of the cylinder 0.3, equatorial axis 0.12; pores
and bars 0.006; spines of its surface 0.012 to 0.15; main axis of the
internal cortical shell 0.2; equatorial axis (in the constriction) 0.06;
pores and bars of its proximal chambers 0.007, of its distal chambers
0.003; large square pores at their base 0.02.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Stations 270 to 274, depth 2350 to 2925
fathoms.



Genus 165. _Panicium_,[204] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Panartida# with simple cortical shell and double medullary
shell, with two opposite apical spines on both poles of the main axis, or
with a group of polar spines.

The genus _Panicium_ comprises those forms of _Panartus_ which develop a
peculiar armature on both poles of the cortical shell. This may be only a
single strong spine {385}on each pole, lying in the main axis (subgenus
_Panicidium_); or a bunch or a circle of polar spines diverging radially
(subgenus _Panartidium_); in the latter case the polar spines can either
form a bunch on the pole itself, or a crown of thorns around it.

main axis is a very strong, conical, apical spine, half as long as the main
axis, on the base one-fourth as broad as the equatorial axis.

hemispherical, somewhat smaller. Pores irregular, roundish, twice to three
times as broad as the bars; four to six on the half meridian, eight to ten
on the half equator of each chamber; a circle of larger square pores on the
base of each distal chamber. Surface thorny. On both poles of the main axis
one strong, pyramidal, apical spine, one-third as long as the main axis, on
the base one-fourth as broad as the equatorial constriction. (Similar to
_Panarium tubularium_, Pl. 40, fig. 9, but without tubes.)

_Dimensions._--Main axis (without polar spines) 0.2, equatorial axis 0.05;
pores 0.005 to 0.01, bars 0.003; length of the polar spines 0.07, basal

hemispherical, somewhat smaller. Pores irregular, polygonal, twice to five
times as broad as the bars; six to eight on the half meridian, twelve to
fourteen on the half equator of each chamber. Surface spiny, covered with
thin, {386}bristle-like spines. On both poles of the main axis a bunch of
six to eight aggregated larger conical spines, about as high as a single
chamber.

_Dimensions._--Main axis (without polar spines) 0.2, equatorial axis 0.06;
pores 0.005 to 0.015, bars 0.003; length of the polar spines 0.05, basal

fathoms.

Both proximal chambers kidney-shaped, covered with short stout spines.
Pores irregular, roundish, twice to four times as broad as the bars; seven
to eight on the half meridian, eleven to thirteen on the half equator of
each chamber. Both distal chambers cap-like, separated from the former by a
circle of ten to twelve very large square pores; the other pores very
small, roundish. The circumpolar area is smooth, surrounded by a circle of
ten to twelve very stout, conical, radial spines, which arise from the
distal ends of the bars separating the large square meshes.

Genus 166. _Peripanicium_,[205] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Panartida# with double cortical shell and double medullary
shell, on both poles of the main axis with two opposite apical spines, or
with a bunch or circle of polar spines.

The genus _Peripanicium_ differs from _Panicium_ only in the development of
an outer reticulated envelope, which mantle-like surrounds the shell, and
represents a second or external cortical shell. As in _Panicium_, its
ancestral form, so also in _Peripanicium_, there can be distinguished two
subgenera:--_Peripanicea_, where only a single large spine arises from each
pole (lying in the main axis), and _Peripanicula_, where a variable number
of spines is to be found, either diverging bunch-like from the pole itself,
or surrounding it as a crown-like polar circle.



Subgenus 1. _Peripanicea_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--On both poles of the main axis only a single large spine.


1. _Peripanicium amphixiphus_, n. sp.

Internal cortical shell with four unequal chambers, with thorny surface.
Both proximal chambers kidney-shaped (with subregular hexagonal pores,
three times as broad as the bars). {387}Both distal chambers nearly
hemispherical (with a circle of ten to twelve very large square pores at
their base, the other pores very small). From both poles arises a single,
strong, conical spine, half as long as the main axis. The internal cortical
shell is very much like that of _Panarium tubularium_ (Pl. 40, fig. 9), but
differs by the solid polar spines (instead of the hollow tubules) and by
the formation of an external, cylindrical, very thin, cortical shell, which
envelops the whole internal, and is connected with it by numerous beams.
The surface of the external shell is quite smooth, and perforated by
innumerable very small roundish pores.

_Dimensions._--Main axis of the external cortical shell 0.25, of the
internal 0.19; transverse axis of the former 0.13, of the latter 0.08;
pores of the proximal chambers of the internal shell 0.01, bars 0.003;
pores of external cortical shell 0.002, bars 0.001; length of both polar
spines 0.12, basal thickness of them 0.02.

_Definition._--On both poles of the main axis a bunch or a circle of
aggregated polar spines.


2. _Peripanicium amphicorona_, n. sp. (Pl. 40, fig. 8).

  _Peripanartus amphicorona_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus et Atlas (pl. xl.
  fig. 8).

Internal cortical shell with four very unequal chambers. Both proximal
chambers kidney-shaped, with subregular, polygonal pores, three times as
broad as the bars. Both distal chambers double cone-shaped; the proximal
cone of these formed by a circle of ten to twelve radial beams, which
separate the same number of large square meshes; the distal cone with five
to six circles of very small roundish, irregular pores. The continuation of
the thin porous lamella of this distal cone forms the external cortical
shell, whose surface is a little rough with innumerable very small thorns.
On both poles is a large circular opening (nearly as broad as the
equatorial constriction of the inner shell), surrounded by a delicate crown
of thorns. The spines of this crown equal the diameter of the polar
opening; they are very thin and bristle-like, connected by a few bridges
and diverge outwards.

_Dimensions._--Main axis (without the crowns of polar thorns) 0.26,
greatest breadth (in the equator of the proximal chambers) 0.15; equatorial
constriction of the external shell 0.12, of the internal 0.07; pores of the
proximal chambers of the internal cortical shell 0.01, of the external
0.005, bars 0.003; diameter of the circular polar opening 0.05; length of
the polar spines 0.05.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.


3. _Peripanicium coronarium_, n. sp.

Internal cortical shell with four unequal chambers. Both proximal chambers
kidney-shaped, with irregular, roundish pores, twice to four times as broad
as the bars. Both distal chambers cap-like, with a basal circle of ten to
twelve large square meshes, the other pores very small. External
{388}cortical shell very thin, with smooth surface, and very small,
irregular, roundish pores; it envelops the whole internal shell at a
constant distance, which equals the breadth of the square meshes. From the
distal ends of the radial beams between the square meshes arise on every
polar circle ten to twelve strong spines, as direct prolongations of those
beams. These form two regular, polar crowns of thorns. The inner part of
the thorns (between both shells) has only one-third to one-fourth the
length of the outer free part. (This species represents a further
development of _Panicium coronatum_, Pl. 40, fig. 4, by secondary formation
of an external mantle, like that of _Peripanartus atractus_, Pl. 40, fig.
7.)

Genus 167. _Panarium_,[206] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 463.

_Definition._--#Panartida# with simple cortical shell and double medullary
shell, with two hollow fenestrated tubes, opposite on the poles of the main
axis.

The genus _Panarium_ differs from _Panartus_ by two hollow latticed tubes,
which start from both poles of the main axis and lie in it. It repeats
therefore in this family the same peculiar and remarkable formation, which
we find in _Pipettella_ among the Ellipsida, in _Pipetta_ among the
Druppulida, in _Cannartidium_ among the Cyphinida, in _Cannartus_ among the
Artiscida, &c.

same size and form, kidney-shaped, about twice as broad as long. Pores of
these subregular, circular, with hexagonal frames, about as broad as the
bars; nine to ten on the half meridian, twelve to fourteen on the half
equator of each chamber. Polar tubuli nearly cylindrical, longer than half
the main axis of the cortical shell, about one-fourth as broad as the
equatorial constriction. Pores of the tubuli of the same shape as those of

eleven on the half equator of each chamber. Polar tubuli slender, conical,
nearly half as long as the main axis of the shell, one-third as broad at
the base as the equatorial constriction. Pores of the tubuli of the same

kidney-shaped. Their pores subregular, circular, three to four times as
broad as the bars; seven to eight on the half meridian, ten to eleven on
the half equator of each chamber. Polar tubuli conical, nearly half as long
as the main axis, half as broad at the base as the equatorial constriction.
Pores of the tubuli like those of the chambers, but only half as broad.

Genus 168. _Peripanarium_,[207] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Panartida# with double cortical shell and double medullary
shell, with two hollow fenestrated tubes, opposite on the poles of the main
axis.

The genus _Peripanarium_ differs from _Panarium_ only in the development of
an outer reticulated envelop, which mantle-like surrounds the shell and
represents a second or external cortical shell. It bears therefore to
_Panarium_ the same relation as _Peripanartus_ to _Panartus_, &c.


1. _Peripanarium cenoconicum_, n. sp.

Internal cortical shell with four kidney-shaped chambers of nearly the same
form and size; their pores irregular, roundish, twice to four times as
broad as the bars.  External cortical shell cylindrical, hemispherical at
both poles, with irregular, very small, roundish pores, only one-third to
one-half as large as those of the internal.  From both poles of the
internal cortical shell arises a hollow conical fenestrated tube, which
perforates the external.  The outer free part of this slender cone equals
in length the inner part or the distance between the two cortical shells,
which is about equal to the length of one chamber. External surface covered
with small thorns. (This species has the same appearance as _Desmartus
larvalis_, Pl. 40, fig. 12, but has only four chambers instead of six.)

_Dimensions._--Main axis (without cones) 0.23, greatest breadth 0.11; pores
of the inner cortical shell 0.004 to 0.009, of the outer 0.002 to 0.003;
bars of the former 0.002, of the latter 0.001; total length of the polar
cones 0.05, basal thickness of them 0.03.

_Habitat._--West Tropical Pacific, Station 225, depth 4475 fathoms.


{391}2. _Peripanarium cenocylindricum_, n. sp.

Internal cortical shell with four unequal chambers, the two proximal
kidney-shaped, the two distal conical, and somewhat smaller; pores
irregular, polygonal-roundish, twice to five times as broad as the bars.
External cortical shell nearly spindle-shaped, in the equatorial zone
inflated, conical, tapering towards both poles, its pores very small,
roundish, its surface covered with small thorns. The shell of this species
resembles very much _Peripanartus atractus_ (Pl. 40, fig. 7), but differs
by the hollow cylindrical polar tubes, which arise from both poles of the
inner cortical shell and attain more than half the length of the main axis.
They are open at their ends (broken away), about as broad as the outer
medullary shell, and perforated by irregular, roundish pores.

_Dimensions._--Main axis (without polar tubes) 0.28, greatest breadth (in
the equator) 0.16; pores of the inner cortical shell 0.004 to 0.01, of the
outer 0.002 to 0.005; bars of the former 0.004, of the latter 0.002; total
length of the polar tubes 0.16, breadth of them 0.03.

Family XVII. #ZYGARTIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 40, figs. 10-13).

_Zygartida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p.462 (_sensu restricto_).

_Definition._--#Prunoidea# with annulated cortical shell, the external
shell being divided by five or more parallel transverse constrictions into
six or more chambers, enclosing in the centre two internal concentric
shells (medullary shells). Central capsule cylindrical, commonly annulated
(corresponding to the transverse annular constrictions of the cortical
shell).

The family #Zygartida#, the seventh and last of the #Prunoidea#, comprises,
in the sense here restricted, all those #Prunoidea# in which the cortical
shell is annulated and composed of six to twenty or more (at least six)
cameræ, lying one behind another in the elongated main axis, and separated
by five or more annular constrictions. When I constituted this family in
1881 (_loc. cit._), I had given to it a much wider extent, embracing all
those #Prunoidea# which exhibit annular constrictions of the cortical
shell; as the number of these, in consequence of further researches, is
much increased, it seems now more convenient to restrict the family to the
extent here given.

No doubt the Zygartida must be derived from the Panartida by progressive
growth of the cortical shell in the main axis and accompanying increase of
the number of its chambers. Whilst this number in the Panartida is
constantly restricted to four, in the Zygartida it amounts to ten, twenty,
or more, and is in the lowest case six (Pl. 40, fig. 10). The maximum
number is variable in the different species, but of course also different
in the various degrees of individual development. Each Zygartid is at the
beginning of its growth a Cyphinid, later a Panartid. The number of the
annular constrictions separating the chambers and lying in parallel
transverse planes is at least {392}five, but may amount to nineteen, to
twenty-one or more; they lie constantly in pairs on both sides of the
equatorial constriction (Pl. 40, figs. 12, 13).

The cortical shell may either remain simple (_Ommatocampe_, Pl. 40, fig.
10), or become double (_Desmocampe_, Pl. 40, fig. 12), or sometimes triple
(_Zygocampe_, Pl. 40, fig. 13).  In the latter cases the outer (secondary
and tertiary) cortical shells are commonly incomplete, and only developed
around the proximal chambers of the complete first (primary) cortical
shell, its distal chambers remaining simple.

_The Medullary Shell_ is constantly double, as in the Panartida; its form
is either spherical or lenticular, compressed in the direction of the main
axis.  It is always connected with the equatorial constriction of the
cortical shell by a number of radial beams, lying either in the equatorial
plane or on each side of it (Pl. 40, figs. 10-13).

_The Central Capsule_ of the Zygartida is constantly cylindrical; its
increasing growth on both poles of the axis corresponds to that of the
including cortical shell. Commonly (but not always) its cylindrical surface
is annulated, with five or more transverse strictures, corresponding to
those of the cortical shell. From the inner surface of the latter it is
separated by a jelly-mantle, the calymma.

Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 832.

_Definition._--#Zygartida# with simple cortical shell and double medullary
shell, without polar tubes.

The genus _Ommatocampe_ was founded by Ehrenberg in 1860 for one of his
"_Haliommatina_," with the following diagnosis:--"Shell rod-like, long,
articulate, with nucleus, without spines, with four or more joints." The
species figured by him, _Ommatocampe {393}polyarthra_, exhibits five pairs
of chambers on both sides of the meridian plane of the cortical shell, the
centre of which includes a double medullary shell. It represents the most
simple form of all Zygartida, and may be derived phylogenetically from
_Cyphonium_ simply by multiplication of the chambers of the cortical shell,
growing on both poles of the main axis.

_Definition._--#Zygartida# with simple cortical shell and double medullary
shell, with two hollow fenestrated tubes, opposite on both poles of the
main axis.

The genus _Ommatartus_ differs from _Ommatocampe_ by the development of two
hollow fenestrated tubes on both poles of the main axis, and bears
therefore the same relation to it as _Cannartidium_ to _Cyphonium_. The
former two genera differ from the two latter by the augmentation of the
chambers of the cortical shell.


{396}1. _Ommatartus amphicanna_, n. sp.

Cortical shell with spiny surface, composed of six chambers of equal size
and kidney-shaped; every chamber with four to five transverse rows of
irregular, roundish pores, twice to three times as broad as the bars. Both
medullary shells lenticular. Polar tubes conical, about as long as one
chamber, with smaller pores. Both medullary shells spheroidal, more or less
compressed. (Resembles _Desmartus larvalis_, Pl. 40, fig. 12, but is

different size and form. Both proximal chambers kidney-shaped, each with
five to six transverse rows of irregular, polygonal pores, three to four
times as broad as the bars. The other (four to six) chambers somewhat
smaller, more hemispherical, with smaller, irregular pores, but on the base
of each a circle of ten to twelve larger square pores. Polar tubuli
prismatic, about half as long as the  main axis, with prominent edges and
longitudinal rows of smaller pores between them. Both medullary shells
lenticular. (Resembles closely _Panarium tubularium_, Pl. 40, fig. 9, but

square pores, and small roundish pores on the cap. Both distal chambers
smaller, conical, with very small roundish pores. Polar tubuli conical,
nearly half as long as the main axis, also with very small pores. Both
medullary shells lenticular.

0.08; pores of the proximal chambers 0.01, bars 0.005; pores of the distal
chambers and the polar tubes 0.002 to 0.004, bars 0.002; length of the
polar tubes 0.13, basal thickness 0.03.

Genus 171. _Desmocampe_,[210] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Zygartida# with double cortical shell and double medullary
shell, without polar tubes.

{397}The genus _Desmocampe_ differs from _Ommatocampe_ in the duplication
of the jointed cortical shell; the radial spines, which start from the
surface of the inner cortical shell, are connected one with another by
transverse communicating branches which form an outer envelop around it;
but this reticulated mantle is commonly not quite perfect and more or less
irregular.

Inner cortical shell with six to eight chambers of the same size and form.
Every chamber kidney-shaped, with three to four transverse rows of
circular, subregular pores, twice as broad as the bars. Outer cortical

form; the distal chambers somewhat smaller. Every chamber kidney-shaped,
with four to five transverse rows of irregular roundish pores, twice to

hemispherical at both poles, with spiny surface; its pores like those of
the inner, but the bars between them much thinner. Distance between the two

Inner cortical shell with six to ten chambers of different size and
structure. Both proximal chambers kidney-shaped, with five to six
transverse rows of subregular, circular, hexagonally-framed pores, twice as
broad as the bars. All following chambers cap-like, with much smaller,
irregular, roundish pores, on the base of each a circle of ten to twelve

4. _Desmocampe atractus_, n. sp.

Inner cortical shell with six chambers of very different size and
structure. Both proximal chambers kidney-shaped, with seven to eight
transverse rows of subregular, roundish pores, twice to three times as
broad as the bars. Both middle chambers cap-like, on the base with a circle
of eight to ten very large square pores, on the distal cap with small
irregular, roundish pores. Both distal chambers conical, also with small

the equatorial zone, tapering conically towards both poles, with very
delicate network of small roundish pores and thin bars. Surface covered

Genus 172. _Desmartus_,[211] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Zygartida# with double cortical shell and double medullary
shell, with two hollow fenestrated tubes, opposite on both poles of the
main axis.

The genus _Desmartus_ differs from _Desmocampe_ by the development of two
hollow fenestrated tubes, opposite on both poles of the main axis, and
bears therefore the same relation to it as _Ommatartus_ to _Ommatocampe_.
Both the former genera can be produced from the two latter by duplication
of the cortical shell.

  _Zygartus larvalis_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus et Atlas (pl. xl, fig. 12).

Inner cortical shell composed of six kidney-shaped chambers of nearly the
same size and structure; every chamber twice as broad as long, with four to
five transverse rows of irregular, roundish pores, twice to five times as
broad as the bars; the basal pores of the distal chambers {399}somewhat
larger and more square. Outer cortical shell cylindrical, hemispherical at
both poles, with irregular, polygonal pores, on an average twice as large
as those of the inner, but the bars between them much thinner. Outer
surface spiny. Both medullary shells lenticular. Polar tubes conical, a
little longer than one internal chamber, as broad at the base as the inner
medullary shell. Sometimes the tubes exhibit prominent edges (as in the
lower spine of fig. 12); the pores of these are very small, and roundish.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 241, depth 2300 fathoms.


2. _Desmartus tubulatus_, n. sp.

Inner cortical shell composed of six to ten kidney-shaped chambers,
tapering in size towards both poles, every chamber with six to seven
transverse rows of irregular, roundish pores, twice to six times broader
than the bars. Outer cortical shell spindle-shaped, in the equatorial zone
inflated, tapering towards both poles, its network similar to the inner,
only more delicate. Polar tubes conical, twice as long as an inner chamber,
as broad at the base as the outer medullary shell. Both medullary shells
lenticular.

Genus 173. _Zygocampe_,[212] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Zygartida# with triple (or multiple) cortical shell and
double medullary shell, without polar tubes.

The genus _Zygocampe_ differs from _Desmocampe_ and _Ommatocampe_ by the
multiplication of the cortical shell, which is composed of three or more
concentric envelopes. The three mentioned genera form therefore a
phylogenetic series, produced by the concentric increase on the outside of
the jointed cortical shell. Commonly the second cortical shell is not as
complete as the first (or innermost), and the third (or outermost) is yet
more incomplete. Rarely the number of the concentric cortical shells
surpasses three.


1. _Zygocampe pupula_, n. sp.

Inner cortical shell with six to twelve chambers of nearly the same size
and form. Every chamber kidney-shaped, with four to five transverse rows of
circular, subregular pores, twice as {400}broad as the bars. Middle
cortical shell cylindrical, hemispherical at both poles, with subregular
circular pores somewhat smaller than those of the inner; the bars also
thinner. Outer cortical shell of the same form as the middle, but with very
delicate network, and quite irregular, roundish pores and very thin bars.
Surface quite smooth. Both medullary shells lenticular. (May be regarded in
a phylogenetic as well as an ontogenetic sense, as the further
developmental form of _Desmocampe catenula_ and _Ommatocampe polyarthra_.)

_Dimensions._--Length of the six-chambered inner cortical shell 0.17, of
the middle 0.22, of the outer 0.27; greatest breadth of the first 0.05, of
the second 0.09, of the third 0.12; pores of the inner cortical shell
0.005, of the middle 0.004, of the outer 0.003 to 0.012; bars of the first
0.003, of the second 0.002, of the third 0.001.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 266, depth 2750 fathoms.


2. _Zygocampe corasium_, n. sp.

Inner cortical shell with six to eight chambers of different size and form.
Both proximal chambers kidney-shaped, with five to six transverse rows of
subregular, circular, hexagonally framed pores, twice as broad as the bars.
All following chambers cap-like, the distal somewhat smaller; their pores
much smaller, irregular, roundish; only at the base of each chamber a
circle of ten to twelve large square pores. Middle cortical shell
cylindrical, in the equatorial zone a little constricted, hemispherical at
both poles, with irregular delicate network of roundish, polygonal meshes.
Outer cortical shell of the same form as the middle, but with a very
delicate and quite irregular network of polygonal meshes. Commonly this
outer mantle is incomplete, and sometimes interwoven in a spongy manner
with the middle (or also with the inner). Surface covered with many
irregular, thin, bristle-like spines. Both medullary shells lenticular.
(May be considered in a phylogenetic and ontogenetic sense as a further
developmental stage of _Desmocampe aphrodite_ and _Ommatocampe nereis_, Pl.
40, fig. 10.)

_Dimensions._--Length of the six-chambered inner cortical shell 0.24, of
the middle 0.3, of the outer 0.36; greatest breadth of the first 0.08, of
the second 0.12, of the third 0.16, pores of the first (on an average)
0.005 to 0.02, of the second 0.003 to 0.015, of the third 0.01 to 0.05;
bars corresponding 0.005 or 0.003 or 0.001.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 253, depth 3125 fathoms.


3. _Zygocampe chrysalidium_, n. sp. (Pl. 40, fig. 13).

Inner cortical shell with six to eighteen chambers of different size and
form. Both proximal chambers kidney-shaped, with six to seven transverse
rows of subregular, circular pores, three to four times as broad as the
bars. All following chambers with more irregular pores, with a circle of
ten to twelve larger square pores at the base. Middle cortical shell with
smaller, irregular, roundish pores. Outer cortical shell with larger
polygonal, quite irregular pores. Both outer shells appear commonly
incomplete or somewhat irregularly developed, and sometimes in a spongy
manner interwoven with one another. Surface covered with irregular,
bristle-like spines. Both medullary shells spherical. The breadth of the
chambers decreases gradually towards both poles, so that the whole shell
assumes a spindle form. Sometimes on both poles is developed a short
conical {401}polar tube (in fig. 13 only on the upper pole), and so this
species is transformed into _Zygartus chrysalis_.

_Dimensions._--Length of the six-chambered inner cortical shell 0.25, of
the middle 0.3, of the outer 0.35; greatest breadth of the first 0.07, of
the second 0.11, of the third 0.14; pores (on an average) 0.01 (0.002 to
0.02), bars 0.002 to 0.005.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Stations 272 to 274, depth 2350 to 2750
fathoms.



Genus 174. _Zygartus_,[213] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 463.

_Definition._--#Zygartida# with triple (or multiple) cortical shell and
double medullary shell, with two hollow fenestrated tubes, opposite on both
poles of the main axis.

The genus _Zygartus_ differs from Zygocampe by the development of two
hollow fenestrated tubes, on the two opposite poles of the main axis. It
exhibits therefore to the latter the same relation that _Desmartus_ does to
_Desmocampe_ and _Ommatartus_ to _Ommatocampe_; it differs from these by
the multiplication of the cortical shell, which is composed of at least
three concentric envelopes.


1. _Zygartus doliolum_, n. sp.

Inner cortical shell composed of six (or more) kidney-shaped chambers, all
nearly of the same size and structure, every chamber with four to five
transverse rows of irregular, roundish pores, twice to four times as broad
as the bars; the basal pores scarcely larger than the apical pores. Middle
cortical shell nearly of the same structure as the inner, only the pores
larger and the bars thinner. Outer cortical shell cylindrical,
hemispherical at both poles, its network very delicate, with large
irregular, polygonal pores, and very thin bars between them; its surface
covered with thin bristle-like spines. Both medullary shells lenticular.
Polar tube cylindrical, with conical apex, and with very small pores; its
length equals the breadth of two internal chambers, its breadth that of the
inner medullary shell. (This species appears to be a further developed form
of _Ommatocampe annulata_ and _Desmartus larvalis_, Pl. 40, fig. 12.)

_Dimensions._--Length of the six-chambered inner cortical shell 0.25, of
the middle 0.3, of the outer 0.35; greatest breadth of the first 0.07, of
the second 0.11, of the third 0.15; pores of the inner shell 0.005 to 0.01,
of the middle 0.003 to 0.007, of the outer 0.008 to 0.02; bars of the first
0.002, of the second and third 0.001; length of the polar tubes 0.15, basal
thickness 0.02.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 270, depth 2925 fathoms.


2. _Zygartus chrysalis_, n. sp. (Pl. 40, fig. 13).

Inner cortical shell composed of six to twenty (commonly eight to twelve)
chambers of different size and form. Both proximal chambers nearly
hemispherical, with spiny surface and subregular, {402}circular pores,
three to four times as broad as the bars. All following chambers cap-like,
tapering towards both poles, with more irregular, roundish pores, with a
circle of ten to twelve larger square pores at the base. Middle cortical
shell with smaller roundish pores. Outer cortical shell with larger
polygonal, quite irregular pores. Both medullary shells lenticular. Polar
tubes conical or cylindrical with conical apex, of very variable length,
sometimes not longer than one internal chamber, at other times twice to
four times as long (in the figured specimen not fully developed, as also a
part of the shells). Differs from _Zygocampe chrysalis_ only by the
production of polar tubes.

_Dimensions._--Length of the six-chambered inner cortical shell 0.25, of
the middle 0.3, of the outer 0.35; greatest breadth of the first 0.07, of
the second 0.11, of the third 0.14; other measures the same as in
_Zygocampe chrysalis_; length of the tubes 0.05 to 0.12 or more.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Stations 270 to 274, depth 2350 to 2925
fathoms.

  _Discida_ vel _Discoidea_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., pp. 56,
      476.
  _Discoida_, _Discoidea_, _Discida_, Haeckel, 1878, Protistenreich, p.
      103.

_Definition._--SPUMELLARIA with discoidal or lenticular central capsule
(often with radial prolongations, rarely allomorphic); with discoidal or
lenticular fenestrated siliceous shell (often with radial spines or
fenestrated arms, rarely allomorphic). Growth reduced or diminished in the
direction of one dimensive axis.

The section #Discoidea# comprises those SPUMELLARIA in which the
fenestrated shell is more or less discoidal or lenticular, flattened or
compressed in the direction of one axis. The geometric fundamental form of
the latticed shell, which in the #Sphæroidea# is a sphere, here becomes a
flat disk, like a medal, or a biconvex lens, sometimes also a biconcave
lens. The #Discoidea# can be derived from the #Sphæroidea# by shortening of
one axis. This shortened vertical axis is the main axis of the disk; both
its poles are constantly equal. Perpendicular to this axis is the
equatorial plane of the disk by which it becomes divided into equal halves.
In the simplest forms of #Discoidea# all axes of this horizontal equatorial
plane (all "equatorial axes" or "cross axes") are equal; in the most of the
genera and species these cross axes are different, so that rays of stronger
growth ("perradii") alternate with rays of weaker growth ("interradii").
The number of these cross axes distinguishable is commonly two to four,
rarely more. In the direction of these are developed either radial marginal
spines or spongy arms.

The order #Discoidea# was founded in my Monograph (1862, p. 476) as the
family "Discida" (Radiolaria with flat discoidal or biconvex lenticular
shell), comprising the {403}"_Calodictya_  and _Lithocyclidina_" of
Ehrenberg and a great part of his "_Haliommatina_." As three different
subfamilies of that family I separated the Coccodiscida (with five genera),
the Trematodiscida (with seven genera), and the Discospirida (with two
genera; Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 485). A fourth group of #Discoidea# was
constituted by the Spongodiscida (with eight genera, including the
_Spongocyclida_), which at that time I united with the Spongurida, because
of their spongy structure (_loc. cit._, p. 452).

As the number of fossil #Discoidea# found in the Tertiary rocks of Barbados
and of the Mediterranean shores (Sicily and Greece) is comparatively very
large, we find even in the first system of Polycystina of Ehrenberg (1847),
not less than twelve genera distinguished, viz., six _Calodictya_, two
_Haliommatina_, and four _Lithocyclidina_ (Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad.
d. Wiss. Berlin, 1847, p. 53). The whole number of Radiolarian genera
distinguished in that first system was forty-four. The diagnoses of them
given by Ehrenberg were as usual very insufficient. The characters of the
three families given by him were the following:--_Calodictya_--"Testarum
intus spongiosarum et nucleo destitutarum orbes; _Haliommatina_--Testæ
subglobosæ nucleus radiatus; _Lithocyclidina_--Testarum disci in media
parte nucleati margine celluloso." In the latest work of Ehrenberg (1875,
p. 157) the same system was repeated, but some new genera added; and
thirty-eight different species, appertaining to the #Discoidea#, were
figured in the same work (Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, 1875, Tafs.
xx.-xxx.).

Richard Hertwig, 1879, in his excellent work, Der Organismus der
Radiolarien (pp. 57-68), gave a detailed description of the skeleton of
some #Discoidea#, and arrived at the conclusion that this whole family had
a spirally constructed skeleton, and should therefore be derived from the
Lithelida. But this conclusion is certainly erroneous, and in my opinion
the whole explanation of that spiral structure, and of its signification in
the development of #Discoidea#, is the weakest part of that otherwise very
important work.

In my Prodromus (1881, p. 456) I gave a provisional system of the #Discida#
or #Discoidea# from the immense quantity of new material collected by the
Challenger, and could distinguish not less than eighty-four genera. This
number is from subsequent research only augmented by seven, so that in the
following pages ninety-one genera with five hundred and one species are
described. In the Prodromus I had disposed them in four different families,
which number is now increased to six. These six families can be again
disposed in two main groups or sections, the #Phacodiscaria# and the
#Cyclodiscaria#, each section with three families.

The #Phacodiscaria# are characterised by the possession of a typical
"phacoid shell," and contain the three families Cenodiscida, Phacodiscida,
and Coccodiscida. On the other hand, the #Cyclodiscaria# are distinguished
by the absence of such a "phacoid shell," and contain the three families
Porodiscida, Pylodiscida, and Spongodiscida. Both sections exhibit an
analogous development.

{404}The #Cenodiscida# (Pl. 48, figs. 1-3) open the series of the
#Discoidea# as their simplest forms; a discoidal or lenticular simple
lattice-shell encloses a central capsule of the same form, and is separated
from it by the calymma or jelly-veil. The common ancestral form of this
family is _Cenodiscus_, without radial marginal spines; it can be derived
from _Cenosphæra_ in the most simple way, by flattening in one axis. If on
the equatorial margin of the lens a peculiar solid girdle be developed, we
obtain _Zonodiscus_; in all other genera of the Cenodiscida radial spines
are developed on the margin. As the simple lenticular cortical shell of
_Cenodiscus_, in which the central capsule is enclosed, is most
characteristic not only of this family, but also of the two following
families, we call it the phacoid shell (that is, a lenticular extracapsular
or cortical lattice-shell).

The #Phacodiscida# (Pls. 31-35), the second family, have the same
extracapsular "phacoid shell" as the Cenodiscida, but differ from these by
the possession of one or two intracapsular concentric medullary shells,
which are connected with the former by radial beams, perforating the
lenticular central capsule. The radial beams are commonly numerous, and
arranged in two opposite bunches around the shortened main axis. But often
also besides these occur other longer radial beams, situated in the
equatorial plane; the number of these is commonly four, and they form a
regular rectangular cross, lying opposite in pairs in two equatorial
diameters, perpendicular one to another. In the simplest genera of this
family (the _Sethodiscida_) the equatorial margin of the phacoid shell is
simple or surrounded by a solid smooth girdle; in all other genera are
developed on the margin solid radial spines lying in the equatorial plane,
either regularly disposed in a somewhat constant number (two to eight,
_Heliosestrida_), or irregularly disposed, in a larger and more variable
number (ten to twenty or more, _Heliodiscida_).

The #Coccodiscida# (Pls. 36-38) form a third family of the #Discoidea#,
directly associated with the Phacodiscida; both have the same
characteristic extracapsular "phacoid shell," which is connected by radial
beams with a simple or double, intracapsular medullary shell. But whilst in
the foregoing family the equatorial margin of the phacoid shell is simple
or only armed with radial spines, in the Coccodiscida it is surrounded by
peculiar concentric chambered girdles, or rings, which resemble those of
the following family, the Porodiscida. Each of these "chambered girdles" is
composed of a circular ring in the equatorial plane, a variable number of
radial beams dividing it into incomplete chambers, and two porous
cover-plates or "sieve-plates," covering the upper and lower face of the
disk. These sieve-plates may be regarded as incomplete lenticular cortical
shells, which are only developed in the peripheral part of the disk, whilst
their central part is represented by the only complete cortical shell, the
"phacoid shell." The number of these concentric chamber-girdles amounts to
from one to ten or more. The margin of the disk is either simple
(Lithocyclida) or armed with radial spines (Stylocyclida), or provided with
two to five chambered radial arms (Astracturida); the structure of the arms
is the same as that of the girdles.

{405}The #Porodiscida# (Pls. 41-47), the largest family of all #Discoidea#,
begins the series of #Cyclodiscaria#, or those #Discoidea# in which there
is no "phacoid shell," but a small simple central chamber surrounded by a
number of small latticed chambers of nearly the same size and form. In the
Porodiscida these chambers are arranged in complete circular concentric
rings or spiral convolutions; in the small family of Pylodiscida the
central chamber is surrounded by three radial arm-chambers separated by
three open spaces; in the third family of #Cyclodiscaria#, the
Spongodiscida, all the chambers are arranged more or less irregularly, and
the whole disk becomes spongy; also the surface of the disk is spongy,
whilst in both former families it is covered by two regular even porous
plates or "sieve-plates." Probably all #Cyclodiscaria# can be derived
phylogenetically from _Archidiscus_, a very small and simple lenticular
disk, which is composed of a small spherical latticed central chamber and
of a single concentric chambered ring or girdle; the margin of this ring is
connected with the central chamber by a variable number of radial beams.
This _Archidiscus_ can be derived either from _Saturnalis_ (Pl. 13, fig.
16.) by the development of lattice-work between the equatorial ring and
both polar faces of the concentric central chamber, or from _Sethodiscus_
(Pl. 33, figs. 1-3) by flattening of the lenticular shell, so that the
enclosed inner medullary shell (the central chamber) meets the outer
phacoid shell at both poles.

The Porodiscida are commonly flat or biconvex (rarely biconcave) disks, the
central chamber of which is surrounded not by a single, but by a variable
number (commonly three to six) of concentric chambered girdles or rings;
they arise from _Archidiscus_ by apposition of new concentric chambered
rings around the first ring, all lying in the equatorial plane. Afterwards
the disk often becomes thickened by apposition of concentric chamber-rings
on both flat sides also, so that two to four or more layers are stratified
one over the other. The circular concentric rings often become interrupted,
or spirally convoluted (wholly or partially); also the chambers sometimes
become irregularly crowded. But in all cases both surfaces of the disk
(upper and lower) continue to be porous plates or sieve-plates, at least in
the centre, but they never become spongy.

The margin of the disk exhibits in the Porodiscida a great variety of
different forms, serving for distinction of subfamilies and of genera. In
the Trematodiscida the margin remains quite simple, as in the Archidiscida,
or is only surrounded by a hyaline equatorial girdle. In the Ommatodiscida
it is distinguished by one or two peculiar oscula, surrounded by a corona
of spines. The Stylodictyida are distinguished by a number of solid radial
spines, and the Euchitonida by a number of chambered, or spongy, radial
arms, arising from the margin of the disk and lying in the equatorial
plane. The variety of these radial marginal appendages is in the
Porodiscida much greater than in the Coccodiscida.

The #Pylodiscida# (Pl. 48, figs. 12-20) represent a new, small, but very
remarkable family of #Discoidea#, all triradial, and distinguished by the
peculiar formation of {406}large open spaces in the latticed discoidal
shell, which reappear in a similar shape among the #Larcoidea# in the
Pylonida (_Tetrapyle_, &c.). We get the best understanding of this peculiar
formation if we return to _Archidiscus_, probably the common ancestral form
of all #Cyclodiscaria#, of the Porodiscida as well as of the Pylodiscida
and Spongodiscida. In some species of _Archidiscus_ (_Archidiscus
hexoniscus_, _Archidiscus pyloniscus_, &c.) the small lenticular shell is
composed of a spherical latticed central chamber and of a concentric
equatorial girdle composed of six such chambers, either all six equal, or
alternately larger and smaller. This latter form is nearly identical with
_Triodiscus_, and if we imagine the lattice-work of only three
ring-chambers complete, whilst that of the three alternating chambers is
reduced to the marginal ring, we get _Triopyle_, by loss of this ring
_Triolene_ (a disk composed of four simple lattice-chambers, lying in one
plane, three radial around one central spherule). The genera mentioned form
together the subfamily of Triopylida. In the second subfamily, Hexapylida,
the same formation is doubled; here three double arm-chambers are separated
by three double spaces (two in each radius). Also here the three distal
spaces may be either quite open (_Pylolena_), or half closed by the
marginal girdle (_Hexapyle_), or quite loosely latticed (_Pylodiscus_). If
the margin of this latter form become surrounded by a perfect chambered
equatorial girdle, we get _Discozonium_, and if this acquire a peculiar
marginal ostium (surrounded by a corona of spines) we arrive at
_Discopyle_. These two latter genera form the third subfamily, the
Discopylida. The eight genera of Pylodiscida represent therefore a
continuous phylogenetic series.

The #Spongodiscida# are the sixth and last family of the #Discoidea#,
differing from the five other families in the irregular, spongy structure
of the discoidal skeleton; both surfaces of the flat disk (upper and lower)
are here principally covered with a rough, spongy framework, whilst in the
five other families they are covered by the flat and smooth porous plates
or sieve-plates. Nevertheless there is no sharp boundary between the
Spongodiscida and the closely allied Porodiscida. In these latter also the
discoidal shell becomes often more or less spongy (mainly in the peripheral
part, _e.g._, in _Myelastrum_, Pl. 47); but at least the central part of
the disk here remains constantly covered by sieve-plates. The massive
skeleton of the Spongodiscida is either of perfectly irregular structure,
only composed of innumerable fine branched siliceous threads, interwoven in
all possible directions; or only the outer part of the disk is composed of
such spongy framework, whilst the central part is more or less distinctly
composed of concentric chambered rings, as in the Porodiscida. These latter
forms indeed exhibit an immediate transition to this family, and were
formerly (in 1862) separated by me as Spongocyclida. Also the polymorphous
shape of the disk margin in the Spongodiscida is quite analogous to that of
the Porodiscida. Whilst in the first subfamily, the Spongophacida, the
margin is quite simple; in the second, the Spongotrochida, it is armed with
solid radial spines; and in the third, the Spongobrachida, it is provided
with two, three, {407}or four spongy, radial arms--the former as well as
the latter lying in the equatorial plane of the disk, either regularly or
irregularly disposed.

_The Equatorial Margin_ of the lenticular disk exhibits in all six families
of #Discoidea# similar characters, mainly serving for the distinction of
subfamilies and genera. In the most primitive genera of all six families
the margin is simple, without radial prolongations (spines or arms); it is
quite simple in _Cenodiscus_, _Sethodiscus_, _Phacodiscus_, _Lithocyclia_,
_Coccodiscus_, _Archidiscus_, _Porodiscus_, _Pylodiscus_, and
_Spongodiscus_. In some genera the simple margin of the lenticular disk is
bordered and surrounded by a thin, hyaline, equatorial girdle of silex,
either quite solid or slightly porous (_Zonodiscus_, _Periphæna_,
_Perizona_, _Perichlamydium_, and _Spongophacus_).

A quite peculiar and remarkable character of few genera is the development
of one or two oscula, larger marginal openings, which are surrounded by a
corona of spines, and probable are fit for the issue a peculiar bunch of
pseudopodia or of a "sarcode flagellum." Such oscula occur only in two
families of #Cyclodiscaria#; in the Porodiscida and Pylodiscida; in the
former _Ommatodiscus_, in the latter _Discopyle_ (Pl. 48, figs. 19, 20) is
distinguished by a single marginal osculum; besides this, in the former
occurs _Stomatodiscus_, with two such oscula, opposite on the poles of one
axis (Pl. 48, fig. 8). These oscula may be compared with the similar polar
formations in some Ellipsida (_Lithomespilus_) and in many Cyrtoidea; but
they do not prove a nearer affinity with the latter, and are only
analogous, not homologous.

_Radial Spines_ occur on the margin in the equatorial plane of the
#Discoidea# in the greatest variety of number, form, size, and disposition.
If the number be low (between two and eight) they are commonly regularly
disposed; if the number be larger (ten to twenty or more) their disposition
becomes commonly more or less irregular. The regular disposition is of
great promorphological importance, as indicating the axes in which the
growth is preponderant, and introduces other peculiar radial formations.
Regarding these axes we can generally distinguish two groups, _Artiacantha_
with a paired number (two, four, eight), and _Perissacantha_ with odd
numbers (usually three). The section of _Artiacantha_ could be divided into
three following groups:--A. Stylodiscida, with two radial spines only,
lying opposite on both poles of one equatorial axis (the "first cross
axis")--_Stylodiscus_, _Sethostylus_, _Stylocyclia_, _Xiphodictya_,
_Spongolonche_ (Pl. 31, figs. 9-12; Pl. 38, fig. 1; Pl. 42, figs. 10-12,
&c.); B. Staurodiscida, with four radial spines, lying opposite in pairs on
the poles of two crossed equatorial axes, perpendicular to one another
(first and second cross axes)--_Crucidiscus_, _Sethostaurus_,
_Staurocyclia_, _Staurodictya_, _Spongostaurus_ (Pl. 31, figs. 1-8; Pl. 37,
figs. 1-4; Pl. 42, figs. 1-6; Pl. 48, fig. 2, &c.); C. Octostylida, with
eight radial spines, opposite in pairs in four axes, which are crossed at
angles of 45°--_Heliosestrum_, _Astrosestrum_, &c. (Pl. 32, figs. 4, 5; Pl.
34, figs. 3, 6); in this latter case sometimes the radial symmetry is the
same as in many Medusæ, four larger (perradial) {408}spines alternating
with four smaller (interradial), indicating radii of first and second
order. The section of _Perissacantha_ is much smaller, and commonly
represented only by triradial forms, with three spines at equal distances
(120°)--_Triactis_, _Tripocyclia_, _Tripodictya_, _Spongotripus_, &c. (Pl.
33, fig. 6; Pl. 37, fig. 5; Pl. 42, figs. 7-9).

_Radial Arms_ on the margin of the disk appear in similar variety of
number, form, and disposition as the radial spines; but the number is here
commonly limited to from two to four, rarely five to six. The arms are
absent in the families Cenodiscida and Phacodiscida; in the four other
families they return under similar forms. These arms are direct
prolongations of the disk, and exhibit the same structure, so that they may
be regarded both as centrifugal productions of certain radii, and also
inversely as peripheral parts of a disk, the interjacent radii of which are
reduced. The regular disposition and shape of the arms, an important
character for the distinction of genera and species, is repeated in a quite
analogous manner in the four above mentioned families, so that we can
distinguish the following groups--A. Amphibrachida, with two radial arms,
opposite on the poles of one equatorial axis (the first cross
axis)--_Diplactura_, _Amphibrachium_, _Spongobrachium_ (Pl. 38, figs. 3-5;
Pl. 44, figs. 6-11); B. Triobrachida, with three radial arms; the most
important group (with all Pylodiscida); either all three arms are equal and
disposed at equal distances (_Trigonactura_, _Dictyastrum_,
_Rhopalodictyum_, Pl. 38, figs. 6-9; Pl. 43, figs. 5, 13, 16; Pl. 48, figs.
12-19), or a single odd arm differs in size and position, and is often
larger than both the opposite paired arms (_Rhopalastrum_, _Euchitonia_,
Pl. 43, figs. 6, 10, 15, &c.); C. Tetrabrachida, with four radial arms,
opposite in pairs in two crossed axes, commonly perpendicular one to
another, _Stauractura_, _Stauralastrum_, _Spongaster_, &c. (Pls. 46, 47).

The arms are commonly simple, undivided, but sometimes also forked or
branched (Pl. 43, figs. 15, 16; Pl. 47). Their basal parts are either free,
separately inserted into the margin of the circular central disk, or they
are connected by a "patagium," a peculiar connecticulum, like a
web-membrane, which is composed of a chambered, commonly more or less
spongy framework, different in texture from the lattice-work of the arms
(Pl. 38, figs. 8, 9; Pl. 43, figs. 9-16; Pl. 46). Sometimes the patagium
overgrows the whole shell. A peculiar modification of it appears in
_Stephanastrum_ (Pl. 44, fig. 1), where only the distal parts of the arms
are connected by the ring-shaped patagium, whilst the basal parts are free;
therefore open gates rest between them, like those of the Pylodiscida (Pl.
48, figs. 12-20).

The _Central Capsule_ of the #Discoidea# is constantly discoidal, more or
less lenticular; in some cases more biconvex, with vaulted faces and thin
margin; in others more medal-shaped, with flat faces and thick margin. In
the Cenodiscida alone the capsule lies freely inside the simple phacoid
shell, and is separated from it by the jelly-veil. In the other five
families the capsule encloses the central parts of the skeleton, and is
enveloped by the superficial parts of it, whilst its membrane is perforated
by radial beams {409}connecting the latter with the former. In the
Phacodiscida and Coccodiscida the capsule encloses the simple or double
medullary shell, but is itself enclosed by the cortical phacoid shell. In
all #Cyclodiscaria# (in the Porodiscida, Pylodiscida, and Spongodiscida)
the capsule fills out the greatest part of the chambered or spongy
skeleton, and is only protected by the superficial parts of it, in the
Porodiscida and Pylodiscida by the covering sieve-plates, in the
Spongodiscida by the spongy cortical substance of the shell. The growth of
the capsule corresponds to that of the including shell, gradually
increasing on the margin in the equatorial plane. Whilst in the greater
number of #Discoidea# its form continues circular, in many forms provided
with radial arms it enters into the arms and assumes their form. The
protoplasm of the capsule is commonly coloured by brown or red pigment, and
often contains many oil-globules. The nucleus is originally enclosed by the
medullary shell or the central chamber, and with increasing size enters
into the surrounding parts; in the #Cyclodiscaria# it often fills out the
internal concentric rings. The extracapsular jelly or the calymma is
commonly thick, and envelops the greater part or the whole body.

Family XVIII. #CENODISCIDA#, n. fam. (Pl. 31, fig. 11; Pl. 48, figs. 1-3).

_Definition._--#Discoidea# with simple extracapsular phacoid shell (or
lenticular latticed cortical shell), without medullary shell and without
chambered equatorial girdles.

The new family #Cenodiscida# opens the long series #Discoidea#, as their
most simple and primitive form. The circular lenticular central capsule is
enclosed by a {410}simple latticed shell of the same form, only separated
from it by a thinner or thicker jelly-veil. The lenticular or discoidal
fenestrated shell is therefore an extracapsular or "cortical shell,"
without an enclosed medullary shell.

The few genera of the Cenodiscida differ only in the shape of the
equatorial margin of the lenticular disk. In the first subfamily,
Zonodiscida, the margin is either quite simple (_Cenodiscus_) or surrounded
by a smooth, solid equatorial girdle (_Zonodiscus_). In the second
subfamily, Trochodiscida, the margin is armed with solid radial spines,
lying in the equatorial plane. According to the number and disposition of
these marginal spines, we distinguish _Stylodiscus_ (with two spines,
opposite in one equatorial axis), _Crucidiscus_ (with four spines, opposite
in pairs in two equatorial axes, perpendicular one to another),
_Theodiscus_ (with three marginal spines), and _Trochodiscus_ (with
numerous, commonly twenty to thirty, irregularly disposed spines). The
spines are constantly simple, not branched; sometimes more conical or
cylindrical, at other times more angular or pyramidal.

The two convex faces of the lenticular shell are constantly of similar
shape, commonly smooth, sometimes more or less thorny, or armed with
bristle-shaped radial spines. The pores are commonly more or less regular,
circular, and disposed in series, which are occasionally more radial, at
other times more concentric. If the wall of the hollow lens be rather
thick, the difference in the shape of the central and peripheral pores is
often striking. The central pores perforating the thick wall
perpendicularly are short cylindrical tubes; the marginal pores perforating
it in an oblique direction are longer conical tubes. The bars between the
central pores are often somewhat smaller.

_The Central Capsule_ of the Cenodiscida is in all cases a perfect,
circular, biconvex lens, the equatorial diameter of which is commonly
between two-thirds and three-fourths of the enclosing lattice-shell. The
interval between the two is filled up by the jelly-veil, or the hyaline
"calymma," which is perforated by the numerous pseudopodia that pass
through the shell-pores.

As the Cenodiscida possess the most simple shell-form of all #Discoidea#,
we may regard _Cenodiscus_ as the common ancestral form of this large
section, in the same manner as _Cenosphæra_ is the ancestral form of
#Sphæroidea#, _Cenellipsis_ of the Prunoidea, Cenolarcus of the Larcoidea.
But it is also possible that a part of Cenodiscida (or all?) arises from
the Phacodiscida by reduction and loss of the medullary shell. For in some
cases we find arising from the inside of the shell centripetal radial
beams, which end at a certain equal distance from the hollow centre (Pl.
31, fig. 11; Pl. 38, fig. 2). Cenodiscus itself can be derived either from
_Cenosphæra_ by compression of the spheroidal shell in one axis, or from
_Sethodiscus_ by loss of the intracapsular medullary shell, or from
_Actidiscus_ (the lenticular Actissa) by formation of a cortical shell
around the lenticular central capsule.

Subfamily 1. ZONODISCIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Cenodiscida# without radial spines on the margin of the
disk.



Genus 175. _Cenodiscus_,[214] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Cenodiscida# with simple margin of the circular disk,
without surrounding equatorial girdle and without radial spines.

The genus _Cenodiscus_ is the most simple and primitive form of all
#Discoidea#, and represents possibly the common ancestral form of this
order. The latticed shell is a simple biconvex lens, and encloses a smaller
central capsule of the same form, separated from it by the jelly-veil.
_Cenodiscus_ can be derived phylogenetically either from _Cenosphæra_ by
lenticular flattening of a simple latticed sphere, or directly from
_Actissa_ by formation of a lenticular fenestrated shell around the
lentiform central capsule. Possibly also some forms of _Cenodiscus_ can be
derived from _Sethodiscus_ by reduction and loss of the medullary shell.


1. _Cenodiscus phacoides_, n. sp. (Pl. 48, figs. 1, 1_a_).

Disk with smooth surface, without radial ribs or spines. Margin of the
lenticular biconvex disk thin, simple. Pores regular, circular; fifteen to
sixteen on the radius of the disk. (Very similar to _Sethodiscus
phacoides_, but without medullary shell.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.2, of the pores 0.005.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.


{412}2. _Cenodiscus rotula_, n. sp.

Disk with smooth surface, without medial ribs or spines. Margin of the disk
blunt, very thick, rounded; both faces little convex. Pores regular,
circular; thirteen to fourteen on the radius of the disk. (Similar to
_Phacodiscus rotula_, Pl. 35, fig. 7, but without medullary shell.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.16, of the pores 0.006.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 241, depth 2300 fathoms.


3. _Cenodiscus lenticula_, n. sp.

Disk with thorny surface, scattered with small, conical spines. Margin of
the lenticular biconvex disk thin. Pores irregular, roundish; ten to eleven
on the radius of the disk.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.15, of the pores 0.008.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 295, depth 1500 fathoms.



Genus 176. _Zonodiscus_,[215] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Cenodiscida# with surrounding solid equatorial girdle on
the margin of the lenticular disk, without radial spines.

The genus _Zonodiscus_ differs from the preceding _Cenodiscus_ only in the
development of a solid siliceous girdle around the keen margin of the
lenticular disk. This form can also be derived from _Periphæna_ or
_Perizona_ by reduction and loss of the medullary shell. The same girdle
formation returns not only in both these Phacodiscida (Pl. 32, fig. 7; Pl.
33, fig. 4), but also in the Porodiscid _Perichlamydium_.


1. _Zonodiscus saturnalis_, n. sp.

Disk with smooth surface, without radial spines. Pores regular, circular,
fifteen to sixteen on the radius of the disk, in its distal half arranged
in fifty to sixty radial series, which are separated by prominent radial
crests or ribs. The crests are prolonged into the proximal half of the thin
solid equatorial girdle, which is one-third as broad as the radius of the
disk.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.25, of the pores 0.05.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic, Station 335, depth 1425 fathoms.



Subfamily 2. TROCHODISCIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Cenodiscida# with radial spines on the margin of the disk,
disposed in the equatorial plane.



Genus 177. _Stylodiscus_,[216] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Cenodiscida# with two radial spines on the margin of the
disk, opposite in one equatorial axis.

{413}The genus _Stylodiscus_ opens the series of the Trochodiscida or of
those Cenodiscida in which the thin margin of the hollow lenticular disk is
armed with a number of solid radial spines, situated in its equatorial
plane. _Stylodiscus_ is at the same time the most simple form of the
Stylodiscida, or of the numerous #Discoidea# (belonging to different
families) in which the disk bears only two spines, opposite in one
equatorial axis. Hitherto only two species of this genus have been
observed, but they seem to represent two different subgenera.



Subgenus 1. _Stylentodiscus_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Internal cavity of the shell with centripetal axial rods.


1. _Stylodiscus endostylus_, n. sp. (Pl. 31, fig. 11).

  _Sethostylus endostylus_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus et Atlas (pl. xxxi,
  fig. 11).

Disk with smooth surface and dentated margin. Pores irregular, roundish;
ten to twelve on the radius of the disk. Marginal teeth conical, short,
irregular. Both opposite polar spines cylindrical, longer than the diameter
of the disk, and as broad as one larger pore. On the inside of the hollow
disk both spines are prolonged into two strong centripetal axial rods,
which do not reach the centre. Also a number of smaller centripetal axial
rods surrounds the central cavity, so that an original medullary shell
(_Sethostylus_) seems to have been lost (comp. above, p. 410).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.25, of the pores 0.005 to 0.02;
length of the polar spines 0.3 and more, thickness 0.012.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 265, depth 2900 fathoms.



Subgenus 2. _Stylexodiscus_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Internal cavity of the shell without axial rods.


2. _Stylodiscus amphistylus_, n. sp.

Disk with smooth surface and smooth margin. Pores regular, circular; eight
to nine on the radius of the disk. Both opposite polar spines pyramidal,
sulcated, about as long as the radius of the disk, and three times as long
as broad at the base. Inner cavity of the disk simple, without centripetal
rods.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.15, of the pores 0.007; length of the
polar spines 0.08, basal breadth 0.03.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 274, depth 2750 fathoms.



{414}Genus 178. _Theodiscus_,[217] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Cenodiscida# with three radial spines on the margin of the
disk, placed in its equatorial plane.

The genus _Theodiscus_ is the most simple form of those very numerous
#Discoidea# in which three rays are developed on the margin of the disk; a
symbol of the Christian dogma of the Trinity. Commonly the three angles
between the three spines are equal, more rarely one angle is larger than
the two others which are equal. The shell of some species is nearly
spherical (formerly separated by me as _Theosphæra_), whilst in others it
is a flattened biconvex lens.



Subgenus 1. _Theodiscoma_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Angles between the three radial spines equal (triangle
equilateral).


1. _Theodiscus divinus_, n. sp.

Disk nearly spherical, with smooth surface. Pores regular, circular,
hexagonally framed; seven to eight on the radius. Three angles between the
spines equal. Spines prismatic, straight, twice as broad as one pore, eight
to eleven times as long as the shell diameter.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.1, of the pores 0.006; length of the
spines 0.8 to 1.1, breadth 0.01.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 265, surface.


2. _Theodiscus christianus_, n. sp.

Disk nearly spherical, with smooth surface. Pores regular, circular,
prolonged into short cylindrical, prominent tubuli, half as high as broad;
eight to nine on the radius. Three angles between the spines equal. Spines
prismatic, straight, twice as broad as one pore, twelve to fifteen times as
long as the shell diameter.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.08, of the pores 0.005; length of the
spines 1.1 to 1.2, breadth 0.01.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.


3. _Theodiscus trinitatis_, n. sp.

Disk a rather flattened, biconvex lens, about twice as broad as thick.

The genus _Crucidiscus_ is the most simple form of the Staurodiscida, or of
the numerous #Discoidea# (belonging to different families) in which the
margin of the disk bears four radial spines, lying in the equatorial plane,
and crossed at right angles. Whilst commonly the internal shell-cavity of
_Crucidiscus_ is quite simple, in one case it bears four centripetal axial
rods, as inner prolongations of the outer radial cross-spines, perhaps
indications of a lost medullary shell (comp. p. 410).

Genus 180. _Trochodiscus_,[219] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Cenodiscida# with numerous (ten to twenty or more) radial
spines on the margin of the disk, situated in its equatorial plane.

The genus _Trochodiscus_ bears on the thin margin of the latticed disk a
variable number of radial spines (commonly ten to twenty, sometimes fifty
to eighty or more). Their size and disposition are commonly more or less
irregular. For the most part all the marginal spines lie in the equatorial
plane; but sometimes part of them are crowded into two or four parallel
girdles. Several species of this genus are very similar to some species of
_Heliodiscus_, and only differ in the absence of the medullary shell,
perhaps in consequence of the phylogenetic loss of it; if this be the case,
the former are to be derived from the latter (compare p. 410).

Family XIX. #PHACODISCIDA#, Haeckel (Pls. 31-35).

_Phacodiscida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 456.

_Definition._--#Discoidea# with simple extracapsular phacoid shell (or
lenticular latticed cortical shell), connected by radial beams with an
intracapsular, simple or double, concentric medullary shell, without
chambered equatorial girdles.

The family #Phacodiscida# comprises a large number of splendid forms (about
a hundred species), which agree with the preceding Cenodiscida in the
possession of the characteristic extracapsular "phacoid shell," but differ
from them in having one or two intracapsular "medullary shells"; these
concentric spherical medullary shells are connected with the lenticular
cortical shell or phacoid shell by means of radial beams perforating the
central capsule. The Phacodiscida bear therefore the same relation to the
Cenodiscida that the Disphærida and Trisphærida do to the Monosphærida.

Formerly several species belonging to the family were described by
Ehrenberg and Johannes Müller, but not distinguished from the Sphæroidea,
genus _Haliomma_ (_e.g._, _Haliomma sol_ et _Haliomma humboldtii_ of the
former, _Haliomma amphidiscus_ of the latter). For these oldest known
species I constituted in 1862 my genus _Heliodiscus_ (Monogr. d. Radiol.,
p. 436). Some other genera were afterwards (1875) figured by Ehrenberg as
_Periphæna_ and _Chilomma_. The rich material of the Challenger revealed
this family as very polymorphic and widely distributed, so that in my
Prodromus (1881, p. 457) I could enumerate eighteen different genera of
Phacodiscida. This number is here reduced to fifteen, uniting several of
them into one genus as "subgenera."

_The Medullary Shell_ of the Phacodiscida, or the intracapsular latticed
shell, is either simple and spherical, or double, composed of two
concentric spheres, which are united by a variable number of radial beams.
We could distinguish therefore as two subfamilies the Carpodiscida (with
simple medullary shell) and the Thecodiscida (with double concentric
medullary shell); the former corresponding to the Carposphærida (or
_Dyosphæria_), the latter to the Thecosphærida (or _Triosphæria_). But as
this difference seems not to be so important as the different shape of the
disk margin, we prefer this latter as a character {420}for the separation
of subfamilies. The form of the medullary shells is commonly quite
spherical (as also in the above mentioned #Sphæroidea#); sometimes it is a
little compressed in the same direction as the enclosing lenticular phacoid
shell. The diameter of the latter is commonly three to four times as large
as the diameter of the medullary shell; if this be double (in the
Thecodiscida) then the diameter of the outer medullary shell is commonly
three to four times as large as that of the inner. The radial beams
connecting the two seem to be very variable in number and disposition
(compare Pl. 31, fig. 8; Pl. 32, figs. 3, 4_a_, 7, 8_a_; Pl. 33, figs. 2,
3; Pl. 35, figs. 4, 8, 9, &c.).

_The Radial Beams_, which connect the medullary shell with the cortical or
"phacoid shell," and which pierce the membrane of the lenticular central
capsule, are commonly aggregated into two polar bunches around the
shortened axis of the disk (compare Pl. 31, fig. 8; Pl. 32, figs. 3, 8; Pl.
33, figs. 2, 3, &c.). Their number seems to be usually between ten and
thirty. More rarely piercing radial beams lie also in the equatorial plane,
and then commonly as inner prolongations of the outer marginal spines; so
we find two opposite in one axis, in _Heliostylus_ (Pl. 34, figs. 1, 2), or
four opposite in pairs in two crossed axes, in _Phacostaurus_ (Pl. 31,
figs. 1, 2, 7). Often the thickness of the beams increases from the centre
towards the periphery.

_The Phacoid Shell_, or the lenticular extracapsular cortical shell,
exhibits in the Phacodiscida quite the same general character as in the
Cenodiscida, above described (p. 410). Commonly the equatorial diameter of
the lens is twice to three times as large as the vertical diameter or the
shortened "main axis." The convexity of both opposite faces is either quite
even to the sharp margin (Pl. 31, fig. 2; Pl. 33, figs. 2, 5), or the
central part of the lens is more strongly vaulted, and often the margin is
thickened or truncated (Pl. 31, fig. 10; Pl. 35, fig. 7). The surface of
the lens is commonly smooth, but sometimes also covered with bristle-shaped
radial spines (Pl. 34, figs. 3, 5; Pl. 32, figs. 2, 3); rarely these spines
are prolonged and branched (Pl. 35, figs. 3, 5). The pores of the phacoid
shell are usually quite regular, circular, and regularly arranged, either
in more concentric or in more radial rows; the latter are sometimes
separated by radial crests arising towards the margin (Pl. 35, fig. 6). If
the wall of the phacoid shell be much thickened, the pores in its central
part are shorter and cylindrical, in its marginal part longer and conical
(Pl. 31, fig. 7; Pl. 32, fig. 1).

_The Margin of the Lens_ of the Phacodiscida is very polymorphic, and
serves mainly for the separation of genera. In the first subfamily,
Sethodiscida, it is either quite simple (Pl. 35, figs. 6-8) or surrounded
by a thin solid equatorial girdle, the basal part of which is often
radially striped (Pl. 32, figs. 7, 8). In the second subfamily,
Heliosestrida, we find on the margin a small number of radial spines in the
equatorial plane regularly disposed, either two opposite in one axis (Pl.
31, figs. 9-12) or four opposite in pairs in two crossed axes (Pl. 31,
figs. 1-8), or eight opposite in pairs in four axes, crossed at angles of
45° (Pl. 34, figs. 3, 6); in the latter case we can sometimes distinguish
{421}(as in many Medusæ) four larger perradial spines alternating with four
smaller interradial spines. Often in one and the same species occur
abnormalities in number and disposition of the radial spines, three or five
spines instead of four, or also seven or nine spines instead of eight;
often both halves of the disk become asymmetrical. If the number of the
marginal spines exceed eight to ten, they commonly become very variable in
size and irregular in disposition; these variations characterise the third
subfamily, Heliodiscida. Commonly also here all spines lie in the
equatorial plane; but sometimes they become crowded in several parallel
circles on both sides of the margin (Pl. 32, fig. 1). The form of the
marginal spines is commonly conical or flattened triangular, often also
pyramidal or deeply furrowed (Pl. 31, figs. 6-9). Very rarely the spines
are fenestrated (Pl. 35, fig. 1); only in one genus (_Heliodrymus_) they
are all or partly branched (Pl. 33, fig. 9; Pl. 35, figs. 3, 5).

The peculiar development of the phacoid shell has been already described by
J. Müller (compare my Monograph, 1862, pp. 156, 438).

_The Central Capsule_ of the Phacodiscida is everywhere circular,
lenticular, envelops the medullary shell, and is enclosed by the phacoid
shell, perforated by the radial beams, which connect the latter to the
former.

Genus 181. _Sethodiscus_,[220] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 457.

_Definition._--#Phacodiscida# with simple medullary shell and simple margin
of the circular disk, without surrounding equatorial girdle and without
radial spines.

The genus _Sethodiscus_ is the most simple and primitive form of all
Phacodiscida, and may be regarded as the common ancestral form of this
family. The simple spherical medullary shell is connected by a variable
number of radial beams with the lenticular or discoidal cortical shell (or
"phacoid shell"). The margin of this latter is quite simple, circular,
without solid equatorial girdle or radial spines. From the nearly allied
genus _Carposphæra_ of the #Sphæroidea#, its probable ancestral form,
_Sethodiscus_ can be derived simply by lenticular compression of the
spheroidal cortical shell.

relation to it that _Thecosphæra_ in the #Sphæroidea# exhibits to
_Carposphæra_. Both former discoidal genera differ from the two latter
spheroidal by the lenticular flattening of the cortical shell.

{426}Genus 183. _Periphæna_,[222] Ehrenberg, 1873 Monatsber. d. k. preuss.
Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 246.

_Definition._--#Phacodiscida# with simple medullary shell, without radial
spines, but with a solid equatorial girdle around the margin of the

_Periphæna decora_ of Barbados, differs from its ancestral form
_Sethodiscus_ in the development of a very thin siliceous solid girdle
around the margin of the lenticular disk; this girdle lies in the
equatorial plane of the shell, and reappears in similar form in
_Perichlamydium_ among the Porodiscida, in _Spongophacus_ among the
Spongodiscida, and in _Zonodiscus_ among the Cenodiscida.

{427}Genus 184. _Perizona_,[223] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 457.

_Definition._--#Phacodiscida# with double medullary shell, without radial
spines, but with a solid equatorial girdle around the margin of the
lenticular disk.

The genus _Perizona_ differs from its ancestral form _Phacodiscus_ in the
development of a thin solid siliceous girdle, lying in  the equatorial
plane around the margin of the disk. The two genera bear the same relation
to each other that _Periphæna_ bears to _Sethodiscus_. But in the two
latter genera the spherical medullary shell is simple, in the two former
double.


1. _Perizona scutella_, n. sp. (Pl. 32, fig. 7).

Disk with smooth surface, in the distal third radiated, four times as broad
as the outer, and ten times is broad as the inner medullary shell. Pores

truncated, abruptly separated in the equatorial circumference from the
peripheral sharp margin of the solid girdle; breadth of the girdle equal to
that of the outer medullary shell.

{428}Genus 185. _Sethostylus_,[224] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 457.

_Definition._--#Phacodiscida# with simple medullary shell and with two
radial spines on the margin of the disk, opposite in the equatorial axis.

The genus _Sethostylus_ opens the series of the Heliosestrida or of those
Phacodiscida in which a constant number of radial spines (two to eight) is
more or less regularly disposed on the margin of the disk. All these
marginal spines lie in the equatorial plane of the lens, and have in the
same species a rather constant number and similar size, a certain form and
disposition. Sometimes they incline more or less to irregular variations.
In _Sethostylus_ there are only two spines, opposite in the equatorial
diameter of the lens; it corresponds to _Stylocyclia_ among the
Coccodiscida, and to _Xiphodictya_ among the Porodiscida.

Margin with a broad solid equatorial girdle, which bears on the periphery
six conical teeth, three on each half between the two main spines, which

The genus _Sethostaurus_ exhibits four marginal spines, which form commonly
a more or less regular cross in the equatorial plane. Sometimes the size
and disposition of the four spines become more or less different, and also
the angles between them vary; the regular rectangular cross passes over
into a bilateral or irregular form. The medullary shell is simple. The same
cross-form of the disk is seen in _Staurocyclia_ among the Coccodiscida,
and in _Staurodictya_ among the Porodiscida.

radial spines on the margin of the disk placed in the equatorial plane.

The genus _Distriactis_ exhibits on the margin of the lenticular phacoid
shell six radial solid spines. Their distance is commonly equal, rarely
unequal. Either all six spines are of equal size and similar form, or three
larger (perradial) alternating with three smaller (interradial), so that
_Distriactis_ appears to be derived from _Triactiscus_ by development of
three secondary between three primary spines.

{438}Genus 191. _Heliosestrum_,[230] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 457.

_Definition._--#Phacodiscida# with simple medullary shell and with eight
radial spines on the margin of the disk (more or less regularly disposed,
sometimes seven or nine).

The genus _Heliosestrum_ (with simple medullary shell) and the following
_Astrosestrum_ (with double medullary shell) contain those Phacodiscida in
which the margin of the lenticular disk bears eight radial spines, commonly
more or less regularly disposed in the equatorial plane, so that the equal
angles between them amount to 45°. There are, however, many exceptions to
this regular eight-rayed form, either the angles between the eight spines
becoming unequal or the number of the spines amounting to seven or nine
(sometimes also six or ten) in one and the same species. But the regular
form is as prevalent, and also in the abnormal forms indicated by the
position of the spines, that we separate the genus _Heliosestrum_ from
_Heliodiscus_. Both genera are rich in common species, and in some of the
former four perradial (larger) spines alternate regularly with four
interradial (smaller) spines.

_Definition._--#Phacodiscida# with simple medullary shell and with numerous
(ten to twenty or more) simple radial spines on the margin of the disk

The genus _Heliodiscus_, the most common and polymorphic of all
#Phacodiscida#, was founded by me in 1862 as the first known type of this
family (_loc. cit._). I use {445}here the diagnosis of this genus in a
restricted sense, including only the species, in which the number of
marginal spines amounts to ten, twenty, or more (sometimes fifty to eighty,
rarely more than one hundred). The number of spines is in the different
species variable, and their disposition commonly more or less irregular,
whilst in the preceding genera (with two, three, four, six, or eight
marginal spines) their distance and form are commonly regular.

(ten to twenty or more) branched radial spines on the margin of the disk
(commonly with a variable number and an irregular disposition of the

The genus _Heliodrymus_ differs from the nearly allied _Heliodiscus_ by the
ramification of the marginal spines, a character hitherto observed in no
other genus of Phacodiscida. The branching is more or less irregular,
either a simple bifurcation or a repeated fissure; the spines and their
branches are commonly more or less flexuose. {451}We can distinguish two
subgenera: in _Heliocladus_ the surface of the disk is smooth, in
_Heliodendrum_ covered with bristle-shaped radial spines, which are either
simple or also branched, sometimes longer than the thick marginal spines.

Family XX. #COCCODISCIDA#, Haeckel (Pls. 36-38).

  _Coccodiscida_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 485.
  _Coccodiscida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 458.
  _Lithocyclidina_, Ehrenberg, 1847, Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad.
      d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 214 (_partim_).

_Definition._--#Discoidea# with extracapsular phacoid shell (or lenticular
latticed cortical shell), connected by radial beams with an intracapsular,
simple or double, concentric medullary shell, and surrounded by one or more
concentric chambered equatorial girdles on the margin.

The family #Coccodiscida# was founded by me in 1862 for those #Discoidea#
which agree with the Phacodiscida in the formation of the lenticular
"phacoid shell" (including a simple or double medullary shell), but differ
from them in the development of peculiar concentric chambered rings or
girdles around the equatorial margin of the disk, similar to those of the
Porodiscida.

The Coccodiscida represent a polymorphic family, in which we here
distinguish sixteen genera with fifty-seven species; it comprises the
greater part of those {456}#Discoidea# which Ehrenberg united in his group
Lithocyclidina (1875, represented by four genera and eight species);
several of these, however, appertain to quite different families, as his
_Astromma entomocora_, _Lithocyclia amphitrites_, &c. His knowledge of the
structure was very imperfect. The peculiar differentiation of the genera
and species exhibits the greatest analogy to that of the following family,
Porodiscida, though the structure of the central disk in both families is
quite different.

_The Phacoid Shell_, or the circular, lenticular cortical shell exhibits in
the Coccodiscida quite the same structure and composition as in the
Phacodiscida, described above (p. 420), so that there can be no doubt as to
the phylogenetic origin of the former from the latter. Quite in the same
way in both families, the lenticular "phacoid shell" is connected by
numerous, short, radial beams with the intracapsular, simple or double,
medullary shell; and also here these beams are commonly disposed in two
groups around the poles of the shortened main axis of the lens, so that
their distal ends are implanted in both circumpolar areas (Pl. 36, figs.
2-6; Pl. 37, figs. 3, 7; Pl. 38, figs. 2, 7). The medullary shell is
commonly simple, spherical, sometimes a little lenticularly compressed;
more rarely it is double, composed of two concentric lattice-shells, which
are connected by radial beams; in this case either both concentric
medullary shells are spherical, or the inner is spherical, and the outer
lenticular, very rarely the inner is lenticular also. In average size and
structure they agree perfectly with those of the Phacodiscida.

_The Chamber Girdles_ or "chambered rings" around the equatorial margin of
the disk, which constitute the only difference between the Coccodiscida and
the Phacodiscida, seem to exhibit a considerable degree of difference of
structure in the numerous species of this family; but I regret that I
cannot explain them here satisfactorily. The study of these structures is
extremely difficult because of the thickness and darkness of the massive
opaque shells; to get a perfect knowledge of them, it is indispensable to
compare slides made in different directions (horizontal slides through the
equatorial and parallel planes, vertical slides through radial and parallel
planes, oblique slides in different directions). But this requires a long
time and a most careful study of the slides, which are very difficult to
get in satisfactory condition. Therefore the following remarks can have
only a provisional value.

In all Coccodiscida we can distinguish on the equatorial chamber-girdle of
the lens-margin (even on superficial inspection) three different elements
of structure, viz.:--(A) concentric circular rings in the equatorial plane;
(B) numerous radial beams piercing the former and dividing them into
imperfect chambers; (C) porous plates or sieve-plates on both convex faces
of the disk. The probable morphological significance of these three
elements is the following:--Each ring or girdle corresponds to an outer
lenticular cortical shell, which is only developed on the marginal part,
whilst its central part is represented by the phacoid shell. Therefore the
radial beams (separating the imperfect chambers) are the same as in the
concentric Polysphærida, and the {457}sieve-plates of the surface are the
porous walls of the cortical shell itself. The correctness of this
explanation seems to be proved by such forms as figured in Pl. 38, figs. 2,
4, where the whole surface of the phacoid shell is covered by a concentric
chamber-work, as a central continuation of the marginal concentric rings.
If we imagine a system of perfect concentric lenticular phacoid shells,
compressed strongly from both poles of the shortened main axis, we get the
same figure.

Rarely one single girdle only is developed on the equatorial margin of the
lenticular disk (Pl. 37, figs. 2, 3, 5). Commonly the number of concentric
girdles amounts to three to six, often to ten to twelve or more. Some of
these largest Coccodiscida reach a considerable size. Commonly all girdles
are of the same breadth, which is about equal to the radius or to the
diameter of the inner medullary shell. Rarely the first (or innermost)
girdle differs by its greater breadth from the succeeding ones (Pl. 36,
fig. 8).

Only in few Coccodiscida the girdle-building remains restricted to the
equatorial planes, so that all the chambers lie in it. Commonly on both
sides of this plane become developed several layers, and often the number
of these (three to six or more) increases towards the periphery; in other
cases not their number, but their height increases. Therefore very often
the margin of the discoidal shell is much thickened, as thick as the centre
of the lenticular phacoid shell (or even more); whilst between the latter
and the former (on the proximal girdles) the disk is considerably thinner
(Pl. 36, figs. 2, 4; Pl. 37, figs. 7, 8; Pl. 38, figs. 2, 4). The
stratified layers communicate by large openings between their chambers. The
radial beams are commonly more or less regular and piercing, but also
frequently irregular and interrupted; often their number increases towards
the margin by intercalation of new beams.

_The Pores_ of the sieve-plates, which cover both sides of the chambered
disk, appear on the margin of the phacoid shell as direct continuations of
the pores of the latter, and sometimes they are so regularly disposed that
one single circular pore is situated on the surface of each chamber (Pl.
36, fig. 7; Pl. 37, fig. 1). But commonly the pores are of variable size
and number, two to three on each chamber, and often quite irregularly
scattered.

_The Margin_ of the chambered disk exhibits many differences, which afford
characters for the distinction of genera. In the first subfamily, the
Lithocyclida, the margin is quite simple without radial appendages. In the
second subfamily, the Stylocyclida, it is armed with solid radial spines
lying in the equatorial plane, and often regularly disposed in the same
manner as in the Phacodiscida (compare above, p. 421). In the third
subfamily, the Astracturida, the margin bears two or more (commonly three
or four) chambered arms, also situated in the plane of the disk, and of the
same structure as the circular chambered girdles (Pl. 38). In some cases
even the whole system of chamber-girdles is represented only by the radial
arms, which are inserted immediately on the margin of the phacoid shell. We
may regard therefore these formations as imperfect chambered disks, which
are developed only in the direction of certain rays {458}(perradii), and
reduced in the direction of the alternating rays (interradii). In some
Astracturida the chambered arms exhibit a structure different from the more
irregular chamber-work between them, so that we can distinguish the latter,
connecting the arms like a web-membrane, as a peculiar "patagium" (as in
many Porodiscida) (Pl. 38, figs. 8, 9). Often the distal ends of the
chambered arms are armed with a radial spine (Pl. 38, figs. 5, 6, 9).

_The Central Capsule_ of the Coccodiscida is originally always of the same
form and shape as in their ancestral group, the Phacodiscida; a circular
lenticular disk, which envelops the simple or double medullary shell and is
enclosed by the cortical phacoid shell. But whilst in the Phacodiscida the
phacoid shell envelops the central capsule perfectly, in the Coccodiscida
it envelops only the capsule from the two flat sides (by the upper and
lower sieve-plates); the marginal part of the lenticular capsule overgrows
the margin of the phacoid shell by peripheral extension, and fills out the
chambered cavity of the concentric girdles. In the Lithocyclida and the
Stylocyclida, where there are no chambered arms, the central capsule
remains a simple circular lens or disk; in the Astracturida, where
chambered radial arms surround the margin of the circular central disk, the
capsule enters also into these arms and fills out the greatest part of
their chambered cavities.

which are pierced by radial beams, and which surround the circular
lenticular cortical shell or "phacoid shell." The latter contains a simple
spherical medullary shell in its centre, and is connected with it by radial
beams. The margin of the disk is circular, quite simple, without radial
spines or chambered arms.

The genus _Stylocyclia_ opens the series of the Stylocyclida or of those
Coccodiscida in which the margin of the chambered disk is armed with solid
radial spines, situated in its equatorial plane, but without chambered
arms. _Stylocyclia_ is the most simple form of this subfamily, and bears
only two marginal spines, opposite in one equatorial axis of the disk. The
medullary shell is simple. This genus corresponds to _Xiphodictya_ in the

margin of the circular disk. Medullary shell double.

The genus _Amphicyclia_ has the same form and structure as _Stylocyclia_,
and differs from it only in the double concentric medullary shell. It bears
therefore to the latter the same relation that _Coccodiscus_ does to
_Lithocyclia_.

of the circular disk.  Medullary shell simple.

The genus _Trigonocyclia_ (only known by one single species, once observed)
bears on the margin of the chambered disk three solid radial spines, at
equal distances one from another.  It corresponds to the genus
_Tripodictya_ amongst the Porodiscida.

_Definition._--#Coccodiscida# with four solid radial spines on the margin
of the disk, crossed in two equatorial diameters perpendicular one to
another. Medullary shell simple.

The genus _Staurocyclia_ is characterised by four radial spines on the
margin of the disk, which are opposite in pairs and situated in two
equatorial diameters, commonly perpendicular one to another. They form
therefore a rectangular cross (rarely more or less irregular). The genus
corresponds exactly to _Staurodictya_ in the family Porodiscida. The
medullary shell is simple.

  _Phacostaurus pyramidalis_, Haeckel, 1879, MS. (as a separate genus).

Phacoid shell two and a quarter times as broad as the medullary shell,
connected with it by twelve radial beams (four equatorial and eight
divergent) and surrounded by one single ring, which is divided by forty
radial beams into regular chambers. Pores regular, honeycomb-like in the

numerous radial beams and surrounded by eight chambered rings, which are
divided by one hundred to one hundred and twenty piercing radial beams into
small chambers. Pores subregular, circular; ten on the radius of the
phacoid shell, two on the breadth of each chamber. Margin of the disk armed
with numerous bristle-shaped radial spines, as long as the breadth of the
chambered girdle. Four very large crossed spines, nearly as long as the

club-shaped distal end thorny, as broad as the medullary shell and three
times as broad as at the narrow base.  I name this splendid species in the
honour of H.R.H. the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Carl Alexander, the
magnanimous protector of arts and sciences, the rector magnificentissimus
of the University of Jena.

_Definition._--#Coccodiscida# with numerous (five or more, commonly thirty
to sixty) solid radial spines on the margin of the circular disk. Medullary
shell simple.

The genus _Astrocyclia_ exhibits on the margin of the circular chambered
disk a large but variable number of solid radial spines, commonly between
thirty and sixty. They are the external prolongations of the inner piercing
radial beams, which divide the concentric rings of the disk into chambers.
All the spines lie in the equatorial plane of the disk. The genus
corresponds to _Stylodictya_ in the family Porodiscida.


1. _Astrocyclia solaster_, n. sp. (Pl. 36, fig. 7).

Phacoid shell two and a half times as broad as the medullary shell,
surrounded by four to six regular rings of equal breadth, which are divided

piercing radial beams into chambers of increasing size. Pores regular,
circular; a single one on each chamber, ten on the radius of the phacoid
shell. On the margin are scattered ten to twenty thick and short spines,
four-sided pyramidal, about as long and as broad at the base as the
diameter of the medullary shell.

six rings of equal breadth, which are divided by twelve to twenty radial
beams into broad chambers. Pores regular, circular; two on the breadth of
each ring, eight on the radius of the phacoid shell. Margin with twelve to
twenty very long and thin, bristle-shaped, radial spines, the prolongations
of the inner beams, longer than the diameter of the disk. (Resembles
_Stylodictya arachnia_, but differs in the possession of a phacoid shell.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk (with six rings) 0.22, of the phacoid
shell 0.09, of the medullary shell 0.045.

two and a half times as broad as the medullary shell, surrounded by three
rings of unequal breadth, the first ring as broad as the second and third

as in the first. The radial beams are alternately thicker and thinner,
prolonged into short marginal spines. Pores subregular, circular; eight on
the radius of the phacoid shell, two on the breadth of the first ring, a
single one on each chamber of the second and third rings.

Genus 203. _Coccocyclia_,[242] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 458.

_Definition._--#Coccodiscida# with numerous (five or more) solid radial
spines on the margin of the circular disk. Medullary shell double.

The genus _Coccocyclia_ has the same form and structure as the foregoing
_Astrocyclia_, and differs from it only in the double concentric medullary
shell. It bears therefore to the latter the same relation as _Coccodiscus_
to _Lithocyclia_.


1. _Coccocyclia liriantha_, n. sp.

Phacoid shell three times as broad as the outer and ten times as broad as
the inner medullary shell, connected with both by six equidistant piercing

equatorial rings, each as broad as the outer medullary shell, and divided
by thirty to forty radial beams into narrow chambers. Pores subregular,
circular, about nine to ten on the radius of the phacoid shell, three to
four on the breadth of each ring. Margin of the disk ciliated, with six
regularly disposed radial spines as prolongations of the inner six piercing

inner medullary shell, and once to twice as long as the diameter of the
whole disk, elegantly undulated, with a conical terminal point.

Subfamily 3. ASTRACTURIDA, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 458.

_Definition._--#Coccodiscida# with two or more (commonly three or four)
chambered radial arms on the margin of the disk, situated in its equatorial
plane (with or without a connecting patagium between the arms).



Genus 204. _Diplactura_,[243] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 458.

_Definition._--#Coccodiscida# with two opposite chambered arms on the
margin of the circular disk, without a connecting patagium.

The genus _Diplactura_ is the simplest form of the Astracturida, or of
those Coccodiscida in which the margin of the disk bears chambered arms,
situated in its equatorial plane. This subfamily corresponds to the
Euchitonida among the Porodiscida, to the Spongobrachida among the
Spongodiscida. In _Diplactura_ there are only two free arms, opposite in
one equatorial diameter (corresponding to _Amphibrachium_ among the former,
to _Spongolena_ among the latter).



Subgenus 1. _Diplacturium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Arms blunt at the distal end, without radial spines.


1. _Diplactura diplobrachia_, n. sp.

Phacoid shell twice as broad as the medullary shell, with six pores on its
radius, without a perfect chambered ring around it. Arms club-shaped, one
and a half times as long as the diameter of the phacoid shell, at the
distal end rounded, blunt, as broad as the latter, at the base only half as
broad.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the phacoid shell 0.08, of the medullary shell
0.04; length of the arms 0.12, basal breadth 0.04, distal breadth 0.08.

{470}Subgenus 2. _Diplactinium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Arms on the distal end armed with a radial terminal spine.


2. _Diplactura diploconus_, n. sp. (Pl. 38, fig. 5).

  _Amphiactura diploconus_, Haeckel, 1877, MS. et Atlas (pl. xxxviii. fig.
  5).

Phacoid shell three times as broad as the medullary shell, with eight pores
on its radius, surrounded by a single chambered ring. Arms club-shaped,
twice as long as the diameter of the phacoid shell, at the distal end as
broad as the latter, at the base only half as broad. Both poles of the
common axis of the arms are armed with a strong spindle-shaped terminal
spine.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the phacoid shell 0.09, of the medullary shell
0.03; length of the arms (without terminal spines) 0.17, basal breadth
0.05, distal breadth 0.09.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 268, depth 2900 fathoms.



Genus 205. _Amphiactura_,[244] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 458.

_Definition._--#Coccodiscida# with two opposite chambered arms on the
margin of the circular disk, connected by a spongy patagium.

The genus _Amphiactura_ differs from the foregoing _Diplactura_ in the
development of a patagium between the arms, and therefore bears the same
relation to it as _Amphymenium_ in the Porodiscida does to _Amphibrachium_,
or _Spongobrachium_ in the Spongodiscida does to _Spongolene_. In this and
in the following #Discoidea# provided with a patagium, this connecting web
constantly exhibits a different texture of its framework, which is
sometimes more regularly chambered, at other times more irregularly spongy.


1. _Amphiactura amphibrachia_, n. sp. (Pl. 38, figs. 3, 4).

Phacoid shell three times as broad as the medullary shell, with eight pores
on its radius. Arms nearly equilateral triangular, twice as long as the
diameter of the phacoid shell, at the truncated distal end as broad as the
latter, at the base only one-third as broad. Patagium a circular lenticular
disk, enveloping only the basal third of the arms, with three to four
concentric circular rings, divided into chambers by about forty radial
beams, which are prolonged beyond the margin of the patagium into radial
spines. The vertical section (fig. 4) shows that the chambers of each arm
(eleven to twelve transverse rows in the radius) are disposed in two
layers.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the phacoid shell 0.09, of the medullary shell
0.03; length of the arms 0.18, basal breadth 0.03, distal breadth 0.09.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 263, depth 2650 fathoms.



{471}Genus 206. _Trigonactura_,[245] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 459.

_Definition._--#Coccodiscida# with three chambered arms on the margin of
the circular or triangular disk, without a connecting patagium.

The genus _Trigonactura_ exhibits three radial arms, which in all known
species are separated by three equal angles. The terminal points of the
arm-axes are the corners of an equilateral triangle. It corresponds
therefore to _Dictyastrum_ among the Porodiscida.



Subgenus 1. _Trigonacturium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Distal end of the arms blunt or truncated, without a
terminal spine.

  _Stephanastrum_ sp., Bury, 1862, Polycystins of Barbados, pl. xv. fig. 7.

Phacoid shell twice as broad as the medullary shell, with five pores on its
radius, without a perfect chambered ring around it. Arms club-shaped, at
the blunt distal end rounded, as long as the diameter of the phacoid shell;
their basal breadth is one-fourth, their distal breadth one-half of its
length.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the phacoid shell 0.1, of the medullary shell
0.05; length of the arms 0.1, basal breadth 0.025, distal breadth 0.05.

fathoms; also fossil in Tertiary rocks of Barbados.


{472}3. _Trigonactura trigonobrachia_, n. sp.

Phacoid shell two and a half times as broad as the medullary shell, with
six pores on its radius, without a perfect chambered girdle. Arms nearly
equilateral triangular, twice as long as the diameter of the phacoid shell,
at the truncated distal end as broad as its diameter and three times as

Genus 207. _Hymenactura_,[246] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 459.

_Definition._--#Coccodiscida# with three chambered arms on the margin of
the circular or triangular disk, connected by a spongy patagium.

The genus _Hymenactura_ differs from the foregoing _Trigonactura_ in the
spongy patagium between the arms, and bears therefore to it the same
relation that among the Porodiscida _Hymeniastrum_ does to the simpler
_Dictyastrum_. The oldest known species of this genus is _Hymenactura
pythagoræ_, described by Ehrenberg as _Hymeniastrum pythagoræ_, but
differing from this in the structure of the central disk.

square chambers, each chamber with one pore on the surface. Patagium
enveloping the basal half of the arms, with four to five rectilinear
parallel rows of chambers, forming together a regular triangle. Differs
from the preceding species mainly in the quite different structure of the
patagium, from the true _Hymeniastrum pythagoræ_ in the phacoid shell of
the central disk, which encloses only one simple medullary shell.

_Definition._--#Coccodiscida# with four chambered arms on the margin of the
circular or quadrangular disk, crossed in two equatorial diameters, without
a connecting patagium.

The genus _Astractura_ has the form of a regular cross, four radial arms
being opposite in two equatorial diameters perpendicular one to another. In
the Porodiscida the same form is repeated by _Stauralastrum_, in the

is _Astromma aristotelis_ of Ehrenberg, in which genus this author
confounded triradial and four-radial forms.

_Definition._--#Coccodiscida# with four chambered arms on the margin of the
circular or quadrangular disk, crossed in two equatorial diameters,
connected by a spongy patagium.

The genus _Stauractura_ differs from the foregoing in the patagium between
the arms, and bears therefore the same relation to it as _Histiastrum_ in
the Porodiscida does to _Stauralastrum_. All known species of this genus
form a regular square, if we connect the end points of the arm axes by
lines.

pores on its radius. Arms club-shaped, nearly as long as the diameter of
the phacoid shell, and one and a half times as long as broad at the distal

the radius. Arms nearly square, about as large as the phacoid shell, with a
strong pyramidal terminal spine at the distal end. Patagium complete,
between every two arms triangular, with rectilinear parallel {479}rows of
chambers; it connects the end points of the arm radius in such a manner
that the whole shell becomes a regular square.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the phacoid shell 0.09, of the medullary shell
0.045; length of the arms 0.1, greatest breadth 0.08.

_Definition._--#Coccodiscida# with five chambered arms on the margin of the
circular or pentagonal disk, without a connecting patagium.

The genus _Pentactura_ possesses five free radial arms, and resembles
_Pentalastrum_ among the Porodiscida. The distance of the five arms seems
to be sometimes equal, at other times different in one and the same
species.

  _Astromma pentactis_, Ehrenberg, 1875, Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss.
  Berlin, p. 66, Taf. xxx. fig. 1.

Phacoid shell two and a half times as broad as the medullary shell, with
eight pores on its radius. Arms regularly or irregularly disposed, nearly
square, about half as large as the phacoid shell, at the truncated distal
end little broader than at the base. In the specimen figured, and very
imperfectly described by Ehrenberg, (_loc. cit._), the arms were
asymmetrically disposed, two opposite in one axis of the disk, two others
on one side of this axis, the fifth opposite to these on the other side.
Another specimen which I found in the Barbados rocks had five arms of equal
size, regularly disposed, at equal intervals.

_Definition._--#Coccodiscida# with five chambered arms on the margin of the
circular or pentagonal disk, connected by a spongy patagium.

The genus _Echinactura_ differs from the foregoing _Pentactura_ in the

Phacoid shell pentagonal, three times as broad as the medullary shell, with

the arms are so connected by the complete patagium that the whole shell
becomes a regular pentagonal disk.

0.035; length of the arms 0.11, basal breadth 0.04, distal breadth 0.06.

on its radius. Arms club-shaped, one and a half times as long as the
diameter of the phacoid shell, in the distal part nearly as broad as the
latter, in the basal part one-third as broad; at the end a strong pyramidal
spine. Patagium nearly complete, with concave dentated margin between each
pair of arms, therefore the pentagonal disk of the whole shell with concave
sides.

      pp. 485, 491, 513.
  _Calodictya_, Ehrenberg, 1847, Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad. d. Wiss.
      Berlin, p. 53 (_partim_).

_Definition._--#Discoidea# without phacoid shell, with flat discoidal
shell, in which a simple spherical central chamber is surrounded by
concentric chambered rings (each ring divided by radial beams into
imperfect chambers).  Surface of the disk on the two flat sides covered by
a porous sieve-plate.

The family #Porodiscida# is by far the largest and richest in different and
common forms among all #Discoidea#; already in my Monograph (1862) nine
genera and twenty-eight species have been enumerated.  Their number is here
increased to more than thirty genera and two hundred species. Many of these
species appertain to the most common and widely distributed SPUMELLARIA,
both living and fossil. But the study of their structure is not easy, and
requires (as in the foregoing Coccodiscida) not only careful examination of
the facial views of the disk, but also of the marginal view and of slides
and sections through different planes.

In my Monograph (1862, pp. 485, 491, 513) I had constituted for these
#Discoidea# two different families, the Trematodiscida and Discospirida;
but the comparative study of a far greater number of different types in the
Challenger collection has since convinced me that those two families are
but little different, and united by transitional forms within one and the
same genus, so that they must be united as Porodiscida. Of the group, which
Ehrenberg formerly had called "Calodictya," many genera appertain to the
Porodiscida, whilst many others are true Spongodiscida.

The Porodiscida represent the first and the most important family of the
#Cyclodiscaria#, or of those #Discoidea# which are devoid of the peculiar
extracapsular lenticular "phacoid shell," characteristic of the three
preceding families (united therefore as #Phacodiscaria#).  Probably all
#Cyclodiscaria# can be derived from _Archidiscus_, from a morphological as
well as a phylogenetic point of view. _Archidiscus_ seems to be the common
ancestral form not only of the Porodiscida, but also of the nearly allied
Pylodiscida and Spongodiscida. This important _Archidiscus_ (Pl. 48, figs.
9-11) is a small lenticular circular disk, in which a simple latticed
spherical central chamber is surrounded by one single concentric ring,
connected with it by a variable number of radial beams in the equatorial
plane. From this typical _Archidiscus_, as from their "architype," all
other #Cyclodiscaria# may be derived; the Porodiscida by regular apposition
of new concentric chambered rings on the margin, the Spongodiscida by
irregular apposition of a spongy framework, the Pylodiscida by a peculiar
interrupted, concentric, triradial growth, three radial arm-chambers
alternating with three open gates or holes, so that already the first
chambered ring is not complete.

{482}_Archidiscus_ (Pl. 48, figs. 9-11) is not only the common phylogenetic
ancestral form of all #Cyclodiscaria#, but also the common ontogenetic
original form of all Porodiscida, or at least of the greater part of them.
The numerous species of _Archidiscus_, which are distinguished in the
sequel, are at the same time the embryonic forms of different Porodiscida,
corresponding to the "biogenetic main law of development." The small shell
of _Archidiscus_ is sometimes completely lenticular, circular, at other
times more or less polygonal; commonly on the biconvex centre much thicker
than on the margin, but sometimes also of nearly equal thickness (like a
medal or a short cylinder). The latticed central chamber of it is probably
in the majority of species spherical, but in some more or less compressed,
lenticular; the number of small pores on its surface is probably commonly
between ten and twenty (four to eight usually being visible on each
hemisphere). The number of radial beams, which connect it with the
equatorial ring, varies commonly from four to eight; but sometimes only two
or three are to be found, in other cases nine to ten or more. The regular
disposition of these beams (in certain equatorial axes of the disk) is
probably of great importance, as determining the later development of
characteristic radial appendages of the margin in the more highly developed
Porodiscida. The equatorial ring itself, forming the margin of the
lenticular disk, is either a simple solid ring or a broader latticed
girdle; in the latter case it merges slowly into the opposite sieve-plates
of the two flat disk sides, or the porous "cover-plates," covering its
parallel or convex surfaces. These latter can be regarded as direct
peripheral continuations of the polar regions of the spherical central
chamber. The ring-chambers, surrounding the latter in a single circle, are
commonly of nearly the same breadth, but often also of different irregular
size. Their number varies between two and ten or more, but commonly between
four and eight; each ring-chamber is covered on the upper and lower side by
the sieve-plate, bounded on the inner (proximal) side by the wall of the
central chamber, on the outer (distal) side by the marginal ring, on both
lateral sides by the contiguous neighbouring ring-chambers.

The important question as to the phylogenetic origin of _Archidiscus_ can
be answered in a twofold way. The most simple form of _Archidiscus_
(_Archidiscus dioniscus_) can be derived immediately from the
Stylosphærida, _Saturnalis_ (Pl. 13, fig. 16), only by the development of
lattice-work between the equatorial ring and the two polar faces of the
concentric central chamber (on the surface of the biconvex jelly-mantle).
But on the other hand _Archidiscus_ may also be derived from the simplest
Phacodiscida, _Sethodiscus_ (Pl. 33, figs. 1-3), by the stronger
compression of the biconvex lenticular shell, so that the enclosed
medullary shell on the two poles runs together with the lenticular phacoid
shell, of which only the peripheral part remains free, and thus forms the
chambered ring; this latter explanation seems the more natural in many
cases, as often in the Porodiscida the central chamber is enclosed in one
or two concentric spherical or lenticular lattice-shells.

{483}The second subfamily of the Porodiscida are the Trematodiscida, which
are derived from the preceding Archidiscida by concentric growth in the
equatorial plane.  In the same way in which the simple chambered ring of
_Archidiscus_ is connected by radial beams with the central chamber, so in
_Porodiscus_ a variable number of concentric rings is connected with that
first ring. The number of these concentric rings varies between two and ten
or more, but commonly amounts to between three and five.  The radial beams
connecting them are either piercing or interrupted; their number increases
gradually from the centre towards the periphery. The chambers between them
are sometimes more regular, at other times more irregular in size and form.
 Their upper and lower wall is formed by the two covering "sieve-plates,"
or the porous cover-plates, which are continued from the central disk to
the margin.  If these two sieve-plates continue being parallel, the disk
becomes medal-shaped or a short cylinder; if the two plates become more or
less concavely vaulted one against the other, the disk becomes biconvex
lenticular, the middle part thicker than the marginal part.  Rarely the
contrary is the case, the margin thicker than the centre, and then the disk
biconcave.

In my Monograph I had separated as two different subfamilies the true
Trematodiscida (with circular concentric rings) from the Discospirida (with
spirally convoluted rings). But the enormous mass of specimens, which I
afterwards examined in the Challenger collection, has convinced me that
this separation was not natural.  For in one and the same genus of most
nearly allied forms we find on one hand quite regular concentric circular
forms (_Trematodiscus_), on the other hand spirally convoluted forms
(_Discospira_), and connecting between them such forms as are in the
central part concentric, in the marginal part spiral (_Perispira_)--or
conversely, these in the centre spiral, on the margin concentric
(_Centrospira_)--and frequently also more or less irregular forms with
interrupted rings (_Atactodiscus_); therefore, all those genera (Prodromus,
1881, Nos. 448-452) have only the value of subgenera of _Porodiscus_. But a
distinct genus is _Perichlamydium_, in which the two sieve-plates run on
the margin of the lens and form a broad hyaline porous or solid girdle.
More important is the distinction of the Ommatodiscida, in which the margin
of the disk exhibits one larger osculum, armed with a corona of spines
(_Ommatodiscus_), or two oscula, opposite on the poles of one axis
(_Stomatodiscus_).  Whilst in many Porodiscida all chambers of the
concentric rings lie in one and the same (equatorial) plane, in many others
with further growth they become stratified in floors, and the whole disk is
therefore composed of two to four or more parallel disks, each with a
system of concentric chambered rings or girdles, quite as in the majority
of the Coccodiscida (p. 457).  Often the central part of the lenticular
disk becomes thickened by apposition of such floors or strata, whilst the
marginal part remains simple, with one single stratum.  The communication
between the chambers of the different strata seems to be the same as in the
similar Coccodiscida.

Also the margin of the disk exhibits in the Porodiscida the same
characteristic {484}differences as in the foregoing family. In the
subfamily of Stylodictyida it bears a certain number of solid radial
spines, often regularly disposed (as in the Stylocyclida). In the subfamily
of Euchitonida the margin is distinguished  by the possession of two to six
or more (commonly three or four) chambered arms, also situated in the plane
of the disk, and of the same structure (sometimes more or less irregular,
spongy). These arms are very variable in size, form, and structure, exhibit
the same peculiarities as in the Astracturida, and are sometimes free, at
other times connected by a "patagium" or an interbrachial spongy skeleton
of different structure, like a web membrane (compare above, p. 458). In
some genera the arms become forked or branched on the distal end.
Sometimes their distal end bears a terminal radial spine.

_The Central Capsule_ of the Porodiscida assumes generally the form of the
including shell, with or without arms, but is constantly somewhat smaller,
as it remains enclosed by the sieve-plates of the disk surface. Often the
capsule is filled with many coloured oil-globules, disposed regularly in
the chamber rows. The nucleus of it is enclosed by the central chamber, and
in many cases by this and the innermost concentric rings.

Subfamily 1. ARCHIDISCIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with a simple spherical or lenticular latticed
central chamber, surrounded by a single concentric latticed ring, which is
divided by radial beams into two to six or more radial chambers.



{486}Genus 212. _Archidiscus_,[251] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with a simple central chamber, surrounded by a
single concentric ring, which is divided by radial beams into two to six or
more radial chambers, without radial spines on the margin.

The genus _Archidiscus_ begins the long and polymorphous series of the
#Cyclodiscaria# or of those #Discoidea# which do not possess the peculiar
"phacoid shell" characteristic of the three preceding families, united as
"#Phacodiscaria#." As already mentioned above, both these groups are
probably of independent origin, derived from the #Sphæroidea# in different
ways (compare pp. 402, 405, &c.). Among all #Cyclodiscaria# _Archidiscus_
is the most simple, and probably the common ancestral form, from which the
other genera may be derived.

_Definition._--Ring with two chambers, separated by two radial beams.


1. _Archidiscus dioniscus_, n. sp.

Ring circular, connected with the central chamber by two radial beams,
opposite in one axis, therefore two equal semicircular ring chambers. (This
primitive form has an interesting reference to _Saturnalis_, Pl. 13, fig.
16, and differs from it only in the lattice-work covering both faces of the
lenticular disk, the margin of which forms the ring.)

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.


2. _Archidiscus dithalamus_, n. sp.

Ring roundish, connected with the central chamber by two radial beams, not
opposite in one axis; both semicircular ring chambers more or less unequal,
one of them larger than the other, and sometimes much more prominent. (If
this prominence increase, we can regard it as the beginning of spiral
convolutions, _Discospira_.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.06, of the central chamber 0.014.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 266, depth 2750 fathoms.



Subgenus 2. _Trioniscus_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Ring with three chambers, separated by three radial beams.


{487}3. _Archidiscus trioniscus_, n. sp.

Ring triangular, roundish, equilateral, connected with the central chamber
by three radial beams at equal distances (120°); therefore three equal ring
chambers. (Resembles the central part of the disk of _Tripodictya
trigonaria_, Pl. 42, fig. 8, and may be the ancestral form of it.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.04, of the central chamber 0.014.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 265, depth 2900 fathoms.


4. _Archidiscus trithalamus_, n. sp.

Ring irregular, roundish, connected with the central chamber by three
radial beams at unequal distances; therefore three ring chambers of
different size. (If these differences be important, they introduce a spiral
convolution in the further development of the _Porodiscus_ arising from
it.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.06, of the central chamber 0.016.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 288, surface.



Subgenus 3. _Tetroniscus_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Ring with four chambers, separated by four radial beams.


5. _Archidiscus stauroniscus_, n. sp. (Pl. 48, figs. 9, 9_a_).

Ring regular, square, connected with the central chamber by four radial
beams at equal distances, opposite in pairs in two axes perpendicular one
to another; therefore four equal ring chambers (or congruent quadrants of
the ring). Resembles the central part of the disk of _Staurodictya medusa_,
&c. (Pl. 42, figs. 1-3); also of _Staurodictya gracilis_, Ehrenberg, 1875
(Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, Taf. xxiii. fig. 3).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.05, of the central chamber 0.016.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 253, depth 3125 fathoms.


6. _Archidiscus tetroniscus_, n. sp.

Ring elliptical, of rhomboidal fundamental form, connected with the central
chamber by four radial beams, halving the sides of the rhombus and opposite
in pairs in two axes which are not perpendicular one to another; therefore
four ring chambers in pairs different, two opposite equal and larger than
the two others.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.05 to 0.07, of the central chamber
0.016.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 263, depth 2650 fathoms.


7. _Archidiscus tetrathalamus_, n. sp.

Ring irregular, quadrangular, connected with the central chamber by four
radial beams of increasing unequal length; therefore all four ring chambers
of different size, gradually increasing {488}in the following quadrants of
the ring. Important as an ancestral type of such spiral and semi-spiral
forms as _Staurodictya cruciata_ (Pl. 42, figs. 4, 12, &c.) and
_Stylodictya clavata_, _Stylodictya stellata_, &c., of Ehrenberg, 1875
(Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, Taf. xxiii. figs. 2, 7, 8, 9).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.05 to 0.08, of the central chamber
0.06.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 295, depth 1500 fathoms.



Subgenus 4. _Pentoniscus_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Ring with five chambers, separated by five radial beams.


8. _Archidiscus pentoniscus_, n. sp.

Ring pentagonal or nearly circular, regular, connected with the central
chamber by five radial beams of equal length and at equal distances (72°);
therefore all five chambers of the ring of equal size and similar form.
(Resembles the central part of the disk of _Pentinastrum asteriscus_, Pl.
44, fig. 2.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.05, of the central chamber 0.015.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 244, surface.



Subgenus 5. _Hexoniscus_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Ring with six chambers, separated by six radial beams.


9. _Archidiscus hexoniscus_, n. sp. (Pl. 48, figs. 10, 10_a_).

Ring regular, hexagonal, or nearly circular, connected with the central
chamber by six radial beams of equal length and at equal distances (60°);
therefore all six chambers of the same size and form. (Resembles the
central part of the disk of _Hexinastrum geryonidum_, Pl. 44, fig. 4.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.06, of the central chamber 0.018.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.


10. _Archidiscus pyloniscus_, n. sp. (Pl. 48, figs. 11, 11_a_).

Ring triangular, connected with the central chamber by six radial beams at
alternating distances; therefore three larger chambers (of looser network)
alternate with three smaller chambers (of denser network); pores of the
former twice to three times as large as those of the latter. This species
is of peculiar importance, as an immediate transitional form to the
Pylodiscida. If these three larger ring chambers lose their few
lattice-beams and so became open gates, we get _Triolene_ or _Triopyle_,
the original forms of the Pylodiscida.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.05, of the central chamber 0.015.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 266, depth 2750 fathoms.


{489}11. _Archidiscus hexathalamus_, n. sp.

Ring irregular, roundish, or hexagonal, connected with the central chamber
by six radial beams of unequal increasing length; therefore all six ring
chambers of gradually increasing size (beginning a spiral convolution,
original form of some _Discospira_).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.05 to 0.07, of the central chamber
0.014.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 300, depth 1375 fathoms.



Subgenus 6. _Circoniscus_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Ring with seven or more chambers, separated by seven or more
radial beams.


12. _Archidiscus octoniscus_, n. sp.

Ring circular or regular octagonal, connected with the central chamber by
eight equidistant radial beams; therefore eight ring chambers of equal
size. (Compare the central part of the disk of _Porodiscus quadrigatus_,
Pl. 41, fig. 3.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.04, of the central chamber 0.014.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 268, depth 2900 fathoms.


13. _Archidiscus polythalamus_, n. sp.

Ring circular, connected with the central chamber by nine to ten or more
radial beams at nearly equal distances. Ring chambers nine to ten, more or
less equal, sometimes also eleven to twelve, more different. (This species
is very variable, and may perhaps be divided into a number of different
"transformistic species.")

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.04 to 0.06, of the central chamber
0.015.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Stations 265 to 274, depths 2350 to 2925
fathoms.



Genus 213. _Axodiscus_,[252] n. sp.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with a simple central chamber, surrounded by
one single concentric ring, which is divided by radial beams into two to
six or more radial chambers; margin of the disk armed with radial spines.

The genus _Axodiscus_ differs from the preceding _Archidiscus_ only in the
shape of the margin of the small lenticular disk, which is armed with a
variable number of radial spines, indicating certain axes or radii of the
shell. If these marginal spines at certain equal distances from the margin
branch and their distal ends become united by these branches forming a
concentric second ring, the genus passes into _Porodiscus_. The different
number and disposition of the marginal spines are probably very important,
{490}as determining the later development of two to four or more radii in
the different genera of Porodiscida.


1. _Axodiscus stylophorus_, n. sp.

Ring circular, with two equal semicircular chambers, connected with the
central chamber by two opposite radial beams, which are prolonged outside
into two strong conical spines.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.05, of the central chamber 0.016.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 266, depth 2750 fathoms.


2. _Axodiscus triradiatus_, n. sp.

Ring regular, triangular, equilateral, connected with the central chamber
by three equidistant radial beams, which are prolonged outside into three
short conical spines. (Differs from _Archidiscus trioniscus_ in the
possession of marginal spines.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.04, of the central chamber 0.013.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 267, depth 2700 fathoms.


3. _Axodiscus staurophorus_, n. sp.

Ring regular, square, connected with the central chamber by four radial
beams, which lie opposite in pairs in two perpendicularly crossed axes, and
are prolonged outside into four delicate cylindrical spines.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the ring 0.045, of the central chamber 0.015.

Subfamily 2. TREMATODISCIDA, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 491
(_sensu emendato et restricto_).

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# without radial appendages of the disk (solid
spines or chambered arms on the margin), and without peculiar oscula on the
margin of the disk, which is composed of two to four or more concentric
rings.



Genus 214. _Porodiscus_,[253] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 459.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with simple circular disk, composed of several
rings (without radial appendages or peculiar oscula on the margin of the
disk).

The genus _Porodiscus_ is, next to its ancestral form, _Archidiscus_, the
simplest and most primitive form of the Porodiscida, from which all other
genera of this family can be derived. The disk is quite simple, without any
marginal appendages, composed of a variable number of rings, commonly of
circular form, sometimes more or less polygonal, elliptical, or irregular.
In my Monograph (1862, pp. 491, 513) I had separated the species, here
united in _Porodiscus_, into two different genera: _Trematodiscus_ with
concentric rings, and _Discospira_ with spiral rings. But the extended
study of these very common forms in a great number of specimens in the
Challenger collection has convinced me that the separation of those two
genera cannot be maintained. In one and the same locality, where one single
characteristic disk-form is very common, we find intermingled quite regular
disks with only concentric, circular rings (_Trematodiscus_), and other
disks with one single perfect spiral ring (_Discospira_); and between
{492}these a smaller number of specimens, in which the rings of the disk
are partly concentric, partly spiral; either the rings of the central part
of the disk are concentric, the outer spiral (_Perispira_), or the
proportion is inverse (_Centrospira_); and sometimes the whole disposition
of the concentric and spiral rings is irregular, and the rings often
interrupted (_Atactodiscus_). Therefore it appears more natural to give to
all these different forms only the value of subgenera of _Porodiscus_, as I
have already proposed in my Prodromus (1881, p. 459). Even the numerous
species of _Porodiscus_ (mainly characterised by the equal or different
breadth of the rings, and by the number, form, and size of the connecting
radial beams and of the superficial pores) are for the most part very
variable and hard to distinguish, as all those characters are not constant.
_Porodiscus_ is a quite "transformistic genus."

spines and chambered arms), surrounded on the margin by a thin porous (but

The genus _Perichlamydium_ differs from _Porodiscus_ only in the
development of a thin, porous, equatorial girdle, which surrounds the
circular margin of the chambered disk. This girdle lies in the equatorial
plane of the lenticular disk, and represents a very delicate siliceous
plate, perforated by numerous small pores. Sometimes the proximal part of
the girdle is ribbed by thin radial beams, the distal prolongations of the
radial rods of the central disk. If these ribs reach the margin of the
girdle and are prominent over it, _Perichlamydium_ passes over into
_Stylochlamydium_.

Subfamily 3. OMMATODISCIDA, Stöhr, 1880, Palæontographica, vol. xxvi. p.
115.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# without radial appendages of the
concentrically annulated disk, but distinguished by one single or two
opposite large marginal oscula, or wide openings on the margin of the disk,
armed with a coronet of spines.



Genus 216. _Ommatodiscus_,[255] Stöhr, 1880, Palæontographica, vol. xxvi.
p. 115.

_Definition._--Porodiscida without chambered arms and radial spines on the
margin of the circular or elliptical disk, but with one large marginal
osculum or opening surrounded by a coronet of spines.

The genus _Ommatodiscus_, together with the following _Stomatodiscus_, form
the peculiar small subfamily of Ommatodiscida, founded by Stöhr in 1880
(_loc. cit._). These remarkable Porodiscida, very nearly allied to
_Porodiscus_, are distinguished by one or two large openings on the margin
of the disk, and these "marginal oscula" are constantly armed with a
coronet of spines (comparable to the osculum coronatum of _Sycon_ in the
Calcispongiæ). Probably in the living Ommatodiscida the osculum is the door
from which a "sarcode-flagellum" issues (comp. above, p. 407). Perhaps this
osculum is comparable to the peculiar coronet of spines which is developed
on one pole of the shell axis in some Ellipsida (_Lithomespilus_,
_Lithapium_). The internal structure of the disk is commonly more or less
obscure, as the lenticular disk is much thickened, sometimes nearly
ellipsoidal. It is possible that the Ommatodiscida are more nearly related
to the Lithelida than to the Porodiscida; but there is no indication of an
internal trizonal medullary shell. Also the apparent resemblance to the
Cyrtida is of no morphological value; both groups are of quite independent
phylogenetic origin.

The genus _Stomatodiscus_ has the same characteristic structure as the
foregoing _Ommatodiscus_, and differs from it only in the duplication of
the large marginal openings. Whilst in the latter there is only one such
marginal osculum, here we find on the margin of the disk two oscula,
opposite on the poles of one equatorial axis.

The genus _Xiphodictya_ opens the series of the Stylodictyida or of those
Porodiscida in which the margin of the chambered disk is armed with solid
radial spines, all situated in the equatorial plane of the disk.
_Xiphodictya_ exhibits the minimum number of spines, two being opposite on
the poles of one equatorial axis of the disk. It repeats, therefore, in
this family the same amphistylic formation as _Sethostylus_ in the
Phacodiscida and _Stylocyclia_ in the Coccodiscida.

spiral line; all nearly of equal breadth. Pores subregular, circular, two
on the breadth of each ring. Two opposite radial spines conical, about as
long as the radius of the disk. Margin of the disk thorny. (Differs from
_Stylodictya heliospira_, Pl. 41, fig. 8, mainly by the two strong,
opposite, radial spines.)

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with three solid, equidistant, radial spines
on the margin of the circular or triangular disk.

The genus _Tripodictya_ exhibits three radial spines on the margin of the
disk, divergent at equal angles; rarely in some specimens the angles differ
more or less. Perhaps this genus bears a near relation to the Dictyastrida
(or to the Euchitonida with three chambered arms--_Dictyastrum_,
_Euchitonia_, &c.).


1. _Tripodictya trigonaria_, n. sp. (Pl. 42, fig. 8).

All rings of the disk concentric, triangular, with three equal convex
sides, all of the same breadth; first and second rings with three simple
chambers, third and fourth rings with six chambers, fifth ring with twelve
chambers. Central chamber also equilateral triangular, from its three
corners arise three piercing perradial beams; from the second ring arise
three interradial beams, alternate with the latter; from the fourth ring
between these and the former arise six adradial beams. Pores subregular,
two on the breadth of each ring. Three marginal spines pyramidal, as long
as the radius of the disk and as broad as one ring.

All rings of the disk, or a part of them, not concentric, spirally
convoluted, of equal breadth, connected by numerous irregular, interrupted
radial beams, the number of which increases from the centre. (In one
marginal view of the disk, Pl. 42, fig. 9, the disk seemed to be composed
of seven {506}parallel chambered plates in the central part, and five
similar plates in the peripheral part.) Pores irregular, roundish, three on
the breadth of each ring. Three marginal spines long and thin, cylindrical
(as in _Staurodictya cruciata_, Pl. 42, fig, 4), longer than the diameter
of the disk, and half as thick as one ring.

Genus 220. _Staurodictya_,[259] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 460.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with four solid radial spines (commonly
crossed at right angles) on the margin of the circular or quadrangular
disk.

The genus _Staurodictya_ is characterised by four marginal spines, lying
opposite in pairs in two crossed equatorial diameters of the disk,
perpendicular one to another. Sometimes the regular rectangular position of
the spines becomes more or less irregular. Commonly the marginal spines are
the extreme prolongations of four internal crossed radial beams, which are
either rectilinear or zigzag-shaped. In the latter case the concentric
disposition of the circular rings becomes more or less spiral. Perhaps
_Staurodictya_ has a near relation to the Stauralastrida (or to the
Euchitonida with four crossed chambered arms--_Stauralastrum_,
_Histiastrum_, &c.).

{509}Genus 221. _Stylodictya_,[260] Ehrenberg, 1847, Monatsber. d. k.
preuss. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 54.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with numerous (five or more, commonly eight to
twelve) solid radial spines, regularly or irregularly disposed on the
margin of the circular or polygonal disk; margin simple, without a porous
equatorial girdle.

The genus _Stylodictya_ comprises the majority of this subfamily, in which
the number of the marginal spines exceeds four. Commonly we find eight to
twelve spines, more or less regularly disposed (four perradial and four
interradial, or four perradial and eight adradial); but often also the
number and disposition become irregular (sometimes very large). In my
Monograph (1862 pp. 495, 515) I had separated the concentric disks with
closed circular rings (as true _Stylodictya_, s. str.) from the spiral
disks with convoluted rings (_Stylospira_). But I retain these two groups
here only as two subgenera, as intermediate forms between them are very
common, and often a part of the disk concentric, a part spiral (compare
above, p. 492).

Genus 224. _Amphymenium_,[263] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 460.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with two simple, undivided, chambered arms,
opposite in one axis, connected by a patagium.

The genus _Amphymenium_ differs from the preceding _Amphibrachium_, its
ancestral form, by development of a patagium or connecticulum between both
arms. This forms a latticed or more spongy envelop, which surrounds either
the middle part of the shell, or the whole shell with exception of the
distal ends of both arms. If the envelop become very spongy, the shell may
be confounded with the cylindrical Ellipside _Spongocore_ (nearly allied to
_Spongurus_); possibly also _Ommatogramma_ of Ehrenberg belongs to this
genus.



Subgenus 1. _Ommatogramma_, Ehrenberg (?).

_Definition._--Both opposite arms of the same size and form, blunt, without
terminal spines.


1. _Amphymenium pupula_, n. sp. (Pl. 44, fig. 8).

Both arms equal, twice as long as broad, three-jointed; the terminal joint
egg-shaped, as large as both other joints together; distal end rounded,
blunt. Patagium nearly complete, enveloping the arms with exception of the
distal end. Perimeter nearly spindle-shaped.

_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm 0.17, greatest breadth 0.06; transverse
breadth of the patagium 0.13.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 273, depth 2350 fathoms.

  Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 317; Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, Taf.
  vi. fig. 7.

Both arms equal, three times as long as broad, spongy, not jointed; distal
end a little club-shaped, blunt. Patagium nearly complete, enveloping the
arms with exception of the distal end. Perimeter nearly lanceolate. The
imperfect diagnosis and figure of Ehrenberg make it doubtful {520}whether
this species belongs to the Porodiscida (_Amphymenium_) or to the
Spongodiscida (_Spongobrachium_) or perhaps to the Spongurida
(_Spongocore_).

_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm 0.1, greatest breadth 0.03; transverse
breadth of the patagium 0.05.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Californian Sea, depth 2600 fathoms, Ehrenberg.


3. _Amphymenium zygartus_, n. sp. (Pl. 44, fig. 7).

Both arms equal, four times as long as broad, with seven to eight joints,
slowly decreasing in size towards the blunt end. Patagium incomplete,
protecting only the middle part of the shell on both sides; on each side
two parallel lattice-plates, connected by transverse radial beams,
perpendicular to the surface. Perimeter nearly rectilinear. (Resembles much
certain forms of _Zygartus_, Pl. 40, but is a true Discoid, no Prunoid.)
Compare also Pl. 45, fig. 8.

_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm 0.2, greatest breadth 0.05; transverse
breadth of the patagium 0.11.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 271, surface.


4. _Amphymenium monstrosum_, n. sp. (Pl. 44, fig. 11).

Both arms equal, little longer than broad, with six to seven convex joints.
The axis of both arms is not common and straight, as in all other species
of this genus, but broken, therefore the incomplete patagium, which
envelops only two to three joints of the arms, is on one side convex, on
the other side concave; it is formed by a simple lattice-plate, connected
with the arms by numerous radial beams. This anomalous form, seen only
once, may perhaps be a monstrosity of _Euchitonia_.

_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm 0.12, greatest breadth 0.06; transverse
breadth of the patagium 0.13.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 290, surface.

distal end with terminal spines.


5. _Amphymenium amphistylium_, n. sp. (Pl. 44, fig. 9).

Both arms equal, three times as long as broad, thickened towards the
truncated distal end, and armed with a strong pyramidal terminal spine.
Each arm with seven joints, separated by convex, transverse septa, and
halved by a radial beam lying in the longitudinal axis. Patagium
incomplete, cylindrical, enveloping only the middle part of the shell.

_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm 0.18, greatest breadth 0.06; transverse
breadth of the patagium 0.08.

_Habitat._--North Atlantic, Station 354, surface.


{521}6. _Amphymenium fusiforme_, n. sp.

Both arms equal, lanceolate, three times as long as broad in the width,
with seven to eight joints. Distal end pointed, armed with a strong conical
terminal spine. Patagium complete, enveloping the whole shell with
exception of the terminal spines. Whole form spindle-shaped.

_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm 0.2, greatest breadth 0.07; transverse
breadth of the patagium 0.15.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic, Station 330, surface.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with two chambered arms, opposite in one axis,
without a patagium; one arm or both forked at the distal end.

The genus _Amphirrhopalum_ differs from _Amphibrachium_, its ancestral
form, by bifurcation of the distal ends of the arms, which may affect
either both arms, or only one of them.

2. _Amphirrhopalum amphidicranum_, n. sp.

Both arms equal, in the proximal half simple, in the distal half forked,
with irregular septa; distal end of each arm blunt, without a terminal

connected by a lateral patagium; one arm or both forked at the distal end.

The genus _Amphicraspedum_ exhibits the same bifurcation of the arms as

development of a patagium, an external connecticulum between the arms,
which envelops the disk totally or partially.

_Definition._--Both arms of equal size and form, without terminal spines of
the branches.

with six to seven transverse septa; distal end of each branch rounded,
blunt, somewhat broader than the base of the whole arm. Divergent axes of
both branches concavely curved. Patagium incomplete, with elliptical

Genus 227. _Dictyastrum_,[266] Ehrenberg, 1860, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.
Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 830.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with three simple, undivided, chambered arms,
without a patagium; triangular shell regular, with three equal arms and
three equal angles.

The genus _Dictyastrum_ is the simplest form of the Trigonastrida, or of
the Porodiscida, in which the margin of the central disk is furnished with
three chambered arms. In _Dictyastrum_ these are quite simple and regular,
without a patagium, separated by equal angles, so that the whole shell
represents a regular, equilateral triangle, if we connect the distal points
of the arms by lines. The genus _Dictyastrum_, founded by Ehrenberg in
1860, differs from his _Rhopalodictyum_--after his own diagnosis--only by
an insignificant difference in the form of the simple arms, which is
scarcely a specific character. I therefore apply this name here in the
above amended sense, seeing that the only figured species of Ehrenberg
(_Dictyastrum angulatum_) occurs in two different, but externally very
similar forms: one of these is a true Porodiscid (_Dictyastrum_) with two
porous covering-plates and concentric rings; the other is a true
Spongodiscid (_Rhopalodictyum_) with quite spongy, irregular network, and
is probably identical with the _Rhopalodictyum truncatum_ of Ehrenberg.

  Berlin, p. 289, Taf. viii. fig. 18.

Arms nearly square with straight edges, towards the truncated end a little
broader, about the same diameter as the triangular central disk. The figure
of Ehrenberg seems to represent a Spongodiscid (_Rhopalodictyum
angulatum_), but in the same locality (Philippine Sea) occurs also a true
_Dictyastrum_ of quite the same form, but with three to four concentric
rings of the central disk, and with jointed arms.

Arms nearly triangular, one and a third times as broad at the distal end as
long, and three times as broad as at the base. Central disk about the same
diameter. In each arm six simple broad chambers. If we connect the six
corners of the truncated distal ends by straight lines, we get a regular
hexagon.

breadth 0.17.

_Habitat._--Equatorial Atlantic, Station 347, surface.

Arms club-shaped, five times as long as broad at the base, at the thickened

as at either end, with thorny surface and numerous conical terminal spines,
one very large in the radius. Central disk triangular, about as broad as
the arms. (Resembles _Rhopalastrum arcticum_, Pl. 43, fig. 6, but differs

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with three simple undivided, chambered arms,
without a patagium; triangular shell bilateral, one odd arm opposite to the
odd angle between two paired arms.

The genus _Rhopalastrum_, founded by Ehrenberg (1847) with a very
insufficient diagnosis, is here retained for those Trigonastrida that agree
in the generic characters with the only species figured by him, viz.,
_Rhopalastrum lagenosum_ (compare my Monograph, 1862, p. 500). It
comprises, therefore, such Euchitonida as agree with the preceding
_Dictyastrum_ in the simple form of the three arms and the absence of a
patagium, but differ from it in the different size of the three angles, and
often also in the divergent form and size of the three arms; one odd arm is
opposite to the odd angle between the two paired arms.

Distance of both paired arms about half as large as their distance from the
odd arm. All three arms nearly of the same form and size, very short and
broad; their breadth nearly equals that of {527}the roundish central disk,
whilst their length reaches only one-fourth of it. End of the arms convex

Distance between the paired arms about two-thirds as large as their
distance from the odd arm. All three arms nearly of the same form and size,
about three times as long as the diameter of the central disk, at the base
one-third as broad as at the convex rounded end, without spines. Stöhr has
only observed a fragment with one arm; some perfect specimens, which I
found in the Caltanisetta-rock, exhibited nearly the same form as
_Rhopalastrum malleus_ (Pl. 43, fig. 1), but differ from this by the
smaller disk, the broader arms, and the smaller angle between the paired
arms.

_Dimensions._--Radius of all three arms 0.2; basal breadth of each arm
0.045, terminal breadth 0.13.

Distance between the paired arms one and a half times as great as their
distance from the odd arm. All three arms nearly of the same form and size,
about one and a half times as long as the diameter of the central disk, at
the base half as broad as at the convex rounded end, without spines.
Ehrenberg has only observed a fragment with two paired arms; some perfect
specimens with three arms, observed by me, differed from the nearly allied
_Rhopalastrum pistillum_ (from the same locality) by the larger disk, the
broader arms, and the larger unpaired angle.

_Dimensions._--Radius of all three arms 0.2, basal breadth 0.05, terminal
breadth 0.09.

_Habitat._--Fossil in Tertiary rocks of Sicily, Caltanisetta.


{528}5. _Rhopalastrum ypsilinum_, n. sp. (Pl. 43, fig. 2).

Distance between the paired arms half as large as their distance from the
odd arm. All three arms at the concavely curved distal end three times as
broad as at the narrow base. Odd arm twice as long and broad as the paired
arms. Central disk smaller than the latter. No terminal spines.

_Dimensions._--Radius of the odd arm 0.32, of the paired arms 0.2; terminal
breadth of the former 0.2, of the latter 0.12.

_Habitat._--Indian Ocean, Cocos Islands, Rabbe, surface.

_Definition._--Arms on the distal end provided with one or more terminal
spines.


8. _Rhopalastrum martellum_, n. sp.

Distance between all three arm-points nearly the same; but the odd arm is
one and a half times as large as both paired arms, and is perpendicular to
the common axis of the latter, therefore the shell has the form of a
hammer. Each arm is twice as broad at the distal end as at the base, and
armed with a conical terminal spine; the latter is vertical in the odd arm,
horizontal in the paired arms.

_Dimensions._--Radius of the odd arm 0.3, of the paired arms 0.15; distal
breadth of the former 0.12, of the latter 0.06.

_Habitat._--North Atlantic, Station 354, surface.


{529}9. _Rhopalastrum triceros_, n. sp. (Pl. 43, fig. 4).

Distance between the paired arms about two-thirds as large as their
distance from the odd arm. All three arms club-shaped, three times as broad
at the thickened distal part as at the base, and armed with one single,

Genus 229. _Hymeniastrum_,[268] Ehrenberg, 1847, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.
Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 54.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with three simple, undivided, chambered arms,
connected by a patagium; triangular shell regular, with three equal arms
and three equal angles.

The genus _Hymeniastrum_ was founded by Ehrenberg (1847) with a very
incomplete diagnosis, and hitherto known only by one single species,
figured by him as _Hymeniastrum pythagoræ_ (Mikrogeol., 1854, Taf. xxxvi.
fig. 31). This form occurs in two different states, externally quite
identical; in one state the central disk (as figured, _loc. cit._), is a
simple lens or hollow disk, containing a medullary shell or "central
chamber"; in the other state the central disk is composed of two concentric
rings surrounding the "central chamber." We retain here the name
_Hymeniastrum_ for this latter state, {530}expressed in the diagnosis given
above, and call the former state (the Coccodiscid) _Hymenactura_ (compare
above, p. 473). One practical advantage, obtained in this way, is that all
genera of #Discoidea# ending with "_-astrum_" belong to the Porodiscida.
_Hymeniastrum_ differs from _Dictyastrum_ by the possession of a patagium,
and from _Euchitonia_ by the equal size of the angles and the arms.

Genus 230. _Euchitonia_,[269] Ehrenberg, 1860, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.
Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 831 (_sensu emendato_).


_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with three simple, undivided, chambered arms,
connected by a patagium; triangular shell bilateral, one odd arm opposite
to the odd angle between the two paired arms.

The genus _Euchitonia_, quite insufficiently characterised by Ehrenberg,
was founded by him (1860) for one single species, afterwards (1872)
described and figured as _Euchitonia furcata_. Retaining this species
correctly as the type of this genus, I give to it here the above diagnosis.
In my Monograph (1862, p. 503) I described seven Mediterranean species of
_Euchitonia_. Three of these have in common the characters according to the
present diagnosis: _Euchitonia mülleri_, _Euchitonia virchowii_,
_Euchitonia beckmanni_; two others appertain (on account of the regular,
not bilateral form) to _Hymeniastrum_, and two others (on account of the
forked, not simple arms) to _Trigonastrum_. Afterwards (1880) three true
fossil species of _Euchitonia_ were described by Stöhr (_Euchitonia
cruciata_, _Euchitonia zittelii_, and _Euchitonia acuta_). Some species of
this genus are cosmopolitan, and appertain to the most common and
everywhere represented #Discoidea#.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with three forked, chambered arms, without a
patagium. (Arms and angles between them either equal or unequal.)

The genus _Chitonastrum_ differs from its ancestral form, _Dictyastrum_, by
the bifurcation of the distal ends of the arms. The few species of this
genus are partly {537}regular (like _Dictyastrum_), partly bilateral (like
_Rhopalastrum_). If the number of species increases much, these two
subgenera may be separated into two genera: _Chitonastrella_ corresponding
to the former, _Chitonastromma_ to the latter.



Subgenus 1. _Chitonastrella_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--All three arms of the same size and form, equidistant;
fundamental form of the shell therefore an equilateral triangle.


1. _Chitonastrum triglochin_, n. sp.

All three arms equal and equidistant. Each arm has the form of an isosceles
triangle, twice as high as broad; the truncated apex of the triangle is
inserted into the large central disk, whilst its distal base (four times as
broad) is divided by a deep incision (half as long as the arm). Each arm
with ten to twelve joints, simple in its basal half, double in its distal
half. Axes of the six branches straight. (Resembles _Trigonastrum
regulare_, Pl. 43, fig. 16, but differs in the absence of a patagium.)

breadth 0.03.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.


2. _Chitonastrum bathybium_, n. sp.

Subgenus 2. _Chitonastromma_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--One odd arm different in size or form from the two other
arms, which are paired; distance between them different; fundamental form
of the shell therefore a bilateral, isosceles triangle.

not so broad, and in the distal half divided into two branches; the
anterior branch is straight, nearly horizontal, the posterior shorter and
curved backwards.

4. _Chitonastrum dicranoides_, n. sp.

All three arms in the basal half simple, nearly square, in the distal half
forked; branches straight, blunt. Odd arm twice as large as the paired
arms; angle between the latter larger than the angles between them and the
odd arm. (The form of the arms resembles _Dicranastrum furcatum_, Pl. 47,

All three arms forked and nearly of the same size, but different in form
and position. The distance between the branches of the two paired arms is
only one-fourth of the distance between them and the odd arm. Each arm in
the basal two-thirds is simple, with eleven to twelve transverse septa, in
the distal third forked, each branch with four to five transverse septa.
The branches of each arm are curved convexly one to another, ending
obtusely. The axis of the simple proximal part is straight in the odd arm,
in the paired arms curved concavely towards the middle line. In the figured
specimen, which I observed living in Portofino (in September 1880), the
central chamber of the central disk and the first surrounding ring were
filled with the nucleus of the cell; both external rings were filled (like
all chambers of the arms) with pink oil-globules of the red central
capsule. From the mantle, enveloping the shell, radiated innumerable fine
pseudopodia (much too short in the figure), and between the two paired arms
a long "sarcode-flagellum."

_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm 0.16; greatest breadth of the odd arm
0.04; basal breadth of the paired arms 0.02; distance of both branches of
each arm 0.08.

Genus 232. _Trigonastrum_,[271] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with three forked, chambered arms, connected
by a patagium. (Arms and angles between them either equal or unequal.)

The genus _Trigonastrum_ differs from the preceding _Chitonastrum_, its
ancestral form, in the development of a patagium between the arms. It bears
therefore to the latter the same relation that _Euchitonia_ does to
_Rhopalastrum_.

_Definition._--All three arms of the same size and form, equidistant;
fundamental form of the shell therefore a regular, equilateral triangle.

  _Chitonastrum regulare_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus et Atlas (pl. xliii.
  fig. 16).

All three arms equal and equidistant. Each arm has the form of an isosceles
triangle, twice as high as broad, the truncated apex of which is inserted
into the large circular central disk, whilst its distal base (four times as
broad) is divided by a deep incision (half as long as the arm). Each arm
with ten to twelve joints.  Patagium between the arms nearly complete,
spongy. (Differs from _Chitonastrum triglochin_ mainly in the possession of
a patagium.)

_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm 0.24, greatest breadth 0.11, basal
breadth 0.03; length of the sides of the regular triangle 0.45.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 274, surface.



Subgenus 2. _Trigonastromma_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--One odd arm different in form or size from the other two
arms, which are paired; distance between them different; fundamental form
of the shell therefore an isosceles triangle.


2. _Trigonastrum krohnii_, Haeckel.

  _Euchitonia krohnii_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 507.

All three arms different; distance between the two paired arms smaller than
their distance from the odd arm. Odd arm with six joints. Each paired arm
with seven joints, increasing in breadth towards the distal end. Odd arm
and one paired arm forked at the end, the other paired arm simple. Patagium
nearly complete. (The asymmetry in this form may perhaps be an individual
anomaly, as also in _Myelastrum anomalum_, Pl. 47, fig. 9.)

_Dimensions._--Radius of the arms about 0.13 to 0.16, breadth 0.05 to 0.08.

Arms different; distance between the paired arms larger than their distance
from the odd arm, which is one-third shorter. Odd arm egg-shaped, simple,
with seven joints, undivided. Both paired arms equal, with ten joints, in
the distal third forked. Patagium nearly complete.

{540}Genus 233. _Stauralastrum_,[272] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with four simple, undivided, chambered arms,
without a patagium; quadrangular shell a regular cross, with four equal
arms placed at right angles.

The genus _Stauralastrum_ is the most simple form of the Tessarastrida, or
of those Porodiscida in which the margin of the central disk is armed with
four chambered arms. In _Stauralastrum_ these four arms are quite simple
and equal, without a patagium, separated by four right angles, so that the
whole shell represents a regular rectangular cross. If we connect the
distal points of the arms by lines, we get a complete square. (In my
Prodromus, 1881, the species of this genus were united with _Hagiastrum_,
which genus I now retain for the simple bilateral Tessarastrida.)

Genus 234. _Hagiastrum_,[273] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 460.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with four simple, undivided, chambered arms,
without a patagium; quadrangular shell bilateral, two opposite arms of the
main axis (or principal arms) different from the two others (or lateral
arms).

The genus _Hagiastrum_, as here defined, was formerly united by me with the
foregoing _Stauralastrum_, but differs from it by the bilateral or
symmetrical form. Whilst in the latter all four arms and the four angles
between them are equal, they are here differentiated into pairs.



Subgenus 1. _Hagiastrella_, Haeckel.

their pear-shaped distal part three times as broad as at their base,
provided with numerous conical spines, one larger terminal spine at their
distal point. (Resembles _Stauralastrum rhopalophorum_, Pl. 45, fig. 1, but
is distinguished by the different size of the arm-pairs, and by the
stronger spines.)

_Dimensions._--Radius of the principal arms 0.3, of the lateral arms 0.2;

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with four simple, undivided, chambered arms,
connected by a patagium; square shell a regular cross, with four equal arms
and four right angles between them.

The genus _Histiastrum_, quite insufficiently characterised by Ehrenberg
(1847), was afterwards (1875) illustrated by the figures of two different
fossil species. One of these, _Histiastrum ternarium_, with three arms,
belongs to _Hymeniastrum_; the other, _Histiastrum quaternarium_, is here
retained as the true, typical representative species of the genus. It
differs from its ancestral form _Stauralastrum_, by the possession of a
patagium, from _Tessarastrum_ by the regular square form of the shell.

circular, little longer than broad; each with eight to nine transverse
chamber-rows; their lateral edges at their base concave, at their end
circular. Central disk with three to four rings, somewhat smaller than one

end twice as broad as at their base), with rectilinear, parallel edges. The

in the equatorial plane, and with one very stout, angular, terminal spine.
Central disk with two to three rings, broader than the arms. Patagium

Cross not rectangular. Both principal arms of equal size and form, four
times as long as broad, and twice as long as the broader lateral arms; the
former with ten to eleven, the latter with five to six joints, separated by
convex transverse septa. Distal ends of the arms blunt. Axes of the smaller
arms not perpendicular to that of the larger arms; therefore the anterior
angles between them smaller than the posterior angles. Patagium between the
arms incomplete. I call this remarkable species after the great German
philosopher David Strauss.

incomplete, enveloping only the basal half of the arms.  (Resembles
_Histiastrum boseanum_, {548}Pl. 46, fig. 1, but differs in the broader

Cross rectangular. Both principal arms of equal size and form, three times
as long as broad, each with ten joints, three times as long as the lateral
arms, which are nearly square, with four joints. All arms rounded, at their
truncated end little broader than at their base. No spines. Patagium
complete, envelops the whole shell, and is composed of two parallel
lattice-lamellæ on each side of the flat disk, which are connected by very
fine perpendicular bars. This is shown clearly in fig. 9, Pl. 45, where the
disk is seen from the edge. I call this species after the great Italian
philosopher Giordano Bruno.

Genus 237. _Stephanastrum_,[276] Ehrenberg, 1847, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.
Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 54.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with four simple, undivided, chambered arms,
connected on the distal ends by a spongy, square or rhomboidal, patagial
girdle (or a patagium with four large, interbrachial openings). Shell
either regular or bilateral (with equal or unequal arms).

{549}The genus _Stephanastrum_, founded (1847) by Ehrenberg for the very
peculiar _Stephanastrum rhombus_, differs from the nearly allied foregoing
genera in the imperfect development of the peculiar patagium, connecting
only the distal ends of the four arms, while it is absent at their base.
Two new species, different from _Stephanastrum rhombus_ by the regular
square form, were found in the Challenger collection.

arises the peculiar patagium, which forms a square with four large
interbrachial openings.

Genus 238. _Dicranastrum_,[277] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 460.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with four forked, spongy, or chambered arms,
without a patagium; shell regular (not bilateral), with four equal arms
crossed at right angles.

The genus _Dicranastrum_ comprises a number of very remarkable, hitherto
unknown, Euchitonida, which are rather common in the Pacific (mainly on the
surface), and characterised by the bifurcation of the cross-arms of the
regular square shell. It bears therefore to its probable ancestral form,
_Stauralastrum_, the same relation that in the triradiate Euchitonida
_Chitonastrum_ does to _Dictyastrum_. The arms are commonly of very
delicate structure, more or less spongy.

little smaller.

_Dimensions._--Radius of the arm 0.45, basal breadth 0.08; breadth of the
terminal branches 0.03.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, east of Japan, Station 241, surface.



Genus 239. _Myelastrum_,[278] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 460.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with four forked, spongy, or chambered arms,
without a patagium; shell bilateral, with paired different arms; two equal
anterior arms of different shape from the two equal posterior arms.

The genus _Myelastrum_ differs from the foregoing _Dicranastrum_, the
ancestral form, by the twofold differentiation of the four arms. Whilst in
the latter all four arms are equal, separated by equal angles, here the two
anterior arms are constantly different from the two posterior. The lateral
angles between the two arm-pairs are equal, while the posterior and the
anterior angle (between the two arms of each pair) are more or less
different. The shell assumes, therefore, a very characteristic bilateral
form, similar to the "quadricorn cross" of the grey central substance in
the transverse section of the human medulla spinalis. Though the spongy
shell is commonly a most delicate and {553}thin disk it nevertheless
reaches unusual dimensions, its diameter in some species being more than a
millimetre.

_Definition._--Posterior arms simple, undivided; anterior arms lobated or
cleft, with one or more incisions at the distal end.

Genus 240. _Pentalastrum_,[279] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 461.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with five simple, undivided, chambered arms,
without a patagium.

The genus _Pentalastrum_ opens the small series of Euchitonida, in which
the shell is not provided with three or four arms, as usual, but with five.
All forms of this little group are rare. Some species resemble in their
external form and in the articulation of their arms certain forms of
Asterida. In _Pentalastrum_, the most simple genus, the five arms are
simple, not forked, and without a patagium. It can be derived from
_Dictyastrum_ or _Stauralastrum_ by increase of the number of arms.



Subgenus 1. _Pentalastrella_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--All five arms equal, with equal angles between them. Shell a
regular pentagon.


1. _Pentalastrum asteracanthion_, n. sp.

All five arms equal, club-shaped, at their thickened obtuse end three times
as broad as at their base, twice as long as broad. Angles between the arms
equal.

_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm 0.2, basal breadth 0.03, distal breadth
0.08.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 272, depth 2600 fathoms.


2. _Pentalastrum astropecten_, n. sp.

All five arms equal, with five to six distinct, simple joints, the basal
joint two-thirds as broad as the terminal joint, which bears a strong
conical spine. Angles between the arms equal. (Resembles _Pentinastrum
asteriscus_, Pl. 44, fig. 2, but has no patagium.)

_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm 0.14, basal breadth 0.024, distal breadth
0.036.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 263, depth 2650 fathoms.



{557}Subgenus 2. _Pentalastromma_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Arms of different sizes, one odd arm larger than the two
others; the opposite odd angle generally different from the four other
angles.


3. _Pentalastrum ophidiaster_, n. sp. (Pl. 44, fig. 3).

Arms nearly triangular, at their obtuse truncated distal end twice as broad
as at their base. Four arms equal, with five joints each; the fifth arm
twice as long, with seven joints. Angles between the arms nearly equal; the
odd angle a little larger.

_Dimensions._--Radius of the larger odd arm 0.25, of the four smaller arms
0.15; basal breadth 0.035, distal breadth 0.07.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 274, surface.


4. _Pentalastrum cometa_, n. sp.

Arms nearly cylindrical, at their obtuse truncated distal end one and a
half times as broad as at their base. Posterior odd arm very large, with
eleven joints, about three times as long as the two lateral arms (with five
joints each) and four times as long as the two anterior arms (with three
joints each). Angles between the paired arms different; the two lateral
angles smaller than the two posterior, and these smaller than the odd
anterior angle.

_Dimensions._--Radius of the odd posterior arm 0.5, of the lateral arms
0.25, of the anterior arms 0.18; basal breadth 0.05, distal breadth 0.08.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 288, surface.



Genus 241. _Pentinastrum_,[280] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 461.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with five simple, undivided, chambered arms,
connected by a patagium.

The genus _Pentinastrum_ differs from the foregoing _Pentalastrum_ only in
the development of a patagium or connecticulum between the arms, and bears
therefore the same relation to it that _Histiastrum_ does to
_Stauralastrum_, or _Hymeniastrum_ to _Dictyastrum_.


1. _Pentinastrum asteriscus_ , n. sp. (Pl. 44, fig. 2).

All arms equal, twice as long as broad, at their base two-thirds as broad
as at their truncated distal end, which bears a strong, pyramidal, terminal
spine. Each arm is divided by five transverse septa into six joints or
chambers, and each of these by a radial beam into a pair of chambers. The
five radial beams arise from the innermost chamber of the central disk, and
end in the five terminal {558}spines. The diameter of the central disk is
larger than the length of the arms. The angles between the arms are equal
and filled up by an incomplete patagium, so that the whole disk forms a
regular pentagon with five concave sides.

_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm (without terminal spine) 0.14; breadth at
their base 0.02, at their terminal joint 0.03; radius of the central disk
0.06.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 266, depth 2750 fathoms.


2. _Pentinastrum goniaster_, n. sp.

  ? _Stephanastrum_ sp., Bury, 1862, Polycystins of Barbados, pl. xx. fig.
  1.

All five arms equal, four times as long as broad, club-shaped, at their
globose distal end twice as broad as at their base, and armed with a strong
conical terminal spine. Diameter of the central disk equals only one-third
of the length of the arms. The articulation of the spongy arms is somewhat
obscure. Patagium complete, totally fills up the interbrachial spaces, so
that the whole disk forms a regular pentagon with five rectilinear sides,
except that the terminal spines project at the corners.

_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm 0.18, basal breadth 0.02, distal breadth
0.04; radius of the central disk 0.05.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 295, depth 1500 fathoms; also fossil in
the rocks of Barbados.



Genus 242. _Pentophiastrum_,[281] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with five forked chambered arms, without a
patagium.

The genus _Pentophiastrum_ differs from the two preceding genera by the
bifurcation of the five arms, and can be derived either from _Pentalastrum_
by the ramification of the distal ends of the arms, or from the similar
_Myelastrum_ by the increase in the number of arms.


1. _Pentophiastrum dicranastrum_, n. sp.

All five arms equal, with equal angles between them. Each arm in the basal
half simple, in the distal half forked; both branches of it equal, with

Genus 243. _Hexalastrum_,[282] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 461.

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with six simple chambered arms, without a
patagium.

The genus _Hexalastrum_, together with the following _Hexinastrum_,
encloses those _Euchitonida_ in which the number of the chambered arms
surrounding the central disk amounts to six. This is the highest number of
these articulated marginal appendages which is reached in any #Discoidea#.
Formerly (1881) in my Prodromus, p. 459, I supposed that the same number
was reached also by one Coccodiscid, and called this genus _Hexactura_.
Afterwards I was convinced that this form was also a _Hexalastrum_.


1. _Hexalastrum palmanthum_, n. sp.

All six arms equal, with equal angles between them. Each arm club-shaped,
three times as long as broad, twice as broad at the thickened distal end as
at the base, without a terminal spine.

_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm 0.2, basal breadth 0.02, distal breadth
0.06.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 274, depth 2750 fathoms.


2. _Hexalastrum crinanthum_, n. sp.

All six arms equal, with equal angles between them. Each arm club-shaped,
four times as long as broad, at the egg-shaped distal end three times as
broad as in the linear basal part, provided {560}with numerous short
conical spines and one longer terminal spine. (Resembles _Stauralastrum
rhopalophorum_, Pl. 45, fig. 1, but with six rays instead of four.)

  _Hexactura orchidacea_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 459.

Arms different in length, so that two unequal opposite odd arms determine
the main axis, and the four other arms lie on both sides of this as two
different pairs. The proportion of their relative length is the
following:--anterior lateral arms five, anterior odd arm six; posterior
lateral arms seven, posterior odd arm eight. Each arm is club-shaped, two
to three times as long as broad, and divided into six to eight joints by
five to seven transverse septa; its distal end is armed with a terminal
spine and twice as broad as its base.

_Dimensions._--Radius of the posterior odd arm 0.4, of the anterior odd arm
0.3; of the posterior lateral pair 0.35, of the anterior lateral pair 0.25;

_Definition._--#Porodiscida# with six simple, undivided, chambered arms,
connected by a patagium.

The genus _Hexinastrum_ differs from its ancestral form _Hexalastrum_ by
the development of a patagium between the arms. The only observed species
is regular.

  _Hexalastrum geryonidum_, Haeckel, 1879, Atlas (pl. xliv. fig. 4).

Disk quite regular with six radii; all six arms of the same size and form,
at their broad, convexly rounded, smooth end five times as broad as at
their narrow base, and little longer than broad. Each arm is divided by

{561}Family XXII. #PYLODISCIDA#, n. fam. (Pl. 48, figs. 12-20).

_Definition._--#Discoidea# without phacoid shell, with flat discoidal
shell, in which a simple spherical central chamber is surrounded by one or
two concentric triradial girdles; each girdle with three gates, separated
by three simple arm-chambers. Surface of the disk with three open or
latticed gates on each flat side.

The family #Pylodiscida# represents a new small but interesting group of
#Discoidea#, which exhibits rather complex affinities to different groups
of #Sphærellaria#. In my Prodromus (1881, p. 464) I had enumerated only two
genera of this family, _Triopyle_ and _Hexapyle_, and had united them with
_Tetrapyle_ and allied genera in the family Pylonida. Indeed, the
resemblance of skeletal structure in the two groups is very great. The most
simple forms of both groups exhibit a simple spherical latticed central
chamber, which is surrounded by few latticed chambers of similar size and
form, separated by open gates. But in the Pylonida these chambers are
opposite in pairs, and form together a complete lattice-girdle around the
central chamber, whereas in the Pylodiscida the chambers are not opposite
in pairs in one axis, and form therefore only latticed half girdles, which
arise from the central chamber like radial arms, and may perhaps better be
called "arm-chambers"; their number is constantly three. The free open
spaces between these three arm-chambers form three gates, comparable to the
two or four gates of _Amphipyle_, _Tetrapyle_, &c., and become afterwards
closed by lattice-work in a similar way in both groups. A more important
difference between them is indicated by the further mode of growth. The
Pylonida build new girdles in all three dimensive planes (alternating in
the transverse, lateral and sagittal planes); their geometric fundamental
form is therefore the "lentellipsis" or the "triaxial ellipsoid." The
Pylodiscida, however, grow only at the periphery of the discoidal shell in
one single plane (the equatorial plane); their fundamental form is
therefore the biconvex lens or the flat disk (a shortened cylinder). This
important difference is my deciding motive, in separating the latter from
the former and in regarding the Pylodiscida as true #Discoidea#, the more
so as they can easily be derived from _Archidiscus_, the fundamental and
ancestral form of the Porodiscida.

One single form of _Archidiscus_ seems to be of peculiar importance in this
relation, viz., _Archidiscus hexoniscus_ (Pl. 48, fig. 10). In this species
the simple central chamber is surrounded by a latticed ring or girdle,
composed of six equal chambers of the same size and form, all lying in the
same plane with the central chamber. In a nearly allied species, viz.,
_Archidiscus pyloniscus_, the six ring-chambers are different, three
smaller (with denser network) alternating with three larger (of looser
network); if we imagine the network of the latter reduced to a marginal bar
we get _Triopyle_, and if also this bar disappear by reduction we get
_Triolena_, the most simple form of the Pylodiscida. {562}Even _Archidiscus
pyloniscus_ may possibly represent the same form among the Porodiscida as
_Triodiscus lenticula_ among the Pylodiscida; this important form indicates
clearly the close affinity of the two families.

If we take the latter, nearly identical form as the common starting point
of both families of Cyclodiscaria, then probably _Triopyle_ and _Triolene_
must be regarded as retrograde forms, derived from _Triodiscus_ in the one
case, from _Archidiscus_ in the other, by reduction of three interradial
arm-chambers, whilst three perradial only remain. But it is also possible
that the most simple form, _Triolene_, originated independently from some
_Cenosphæra_, three simple radial chambers, like the latticed central
chamber, being derived from the latter by apposition in three equidistant
radii, whilst three other radii between them remained free. In this case
the other genera of Pylodiscida are derived from their ancestral form
_Triolene_.

Adopting this latter view, we find that all eight genera of Pylodiscida,
here distinguished, may be regarded as following members of a continuous
series. If the three simple arm-chambers of _Triolene_, surrounding the
equal central chamber, become united at their distal ends by a concentric
equatorial ring, then originates _Triopyle_; and this graduates into
_Triodiscus_ by fenestration of the three open gates between the three
latticed arms. Whilst these three genera form together the subfamily
Triopylida, a second family, Hexapylida, is composed of three other
analogous genera, in which the same process of development becomes
repeated.

_Pylolena_, the most simple form of Hexapylida, arises from _Triodiscus_ by
the development of three new arm-chambers (of the second order) which are
apposed at the distal end of the three primary arm-chambers (of the first
order) in the same radius. If the distal ends of these three secondary
arm-chambers become united by a concentric latticed ring or girdle, we get
_Hexapyle_ (with six open gates, two in each radius), and if its six gates
become afterwards closed by loose lattice-work, we arrive at _Pylodiscus_
(a repetition of _Triodiscus_).

A third subfamily, Discopylida, is formed by the building of a chambered
equatorial girdle around the margin of _Pylodiscus_. This girdle has quite
the same structure as the similar chambered rings or girdles of the
Porodiscida and Coccodiscida. Between the two sieve-plates of the disk
surface is enclosed a variable number (twelve to twenty-four or more) of
chambers, imperfectly separated by radial beams, which connect the margin
of the _Pylodiscus_-shell with an outer peripheral concentric ring. In
_Discozonium_ this marginal ring is perfect, whilst in _Discopyle_ it is
interrupted by a peculiar large opening, a "marginal osculum" surrounded by
a corona of spines, quite the same remarkable formation which we
encountered in _Ommatodiscus_ among the Porodiscida.

All Pylodiscida are therefore triradial (with three perradial arms and
three interradial gates between them), and many of them have a great
resemblance to certain triradial Porodiscida and Spongodiscida, perhaps not
only a morphological resemblance, but also {563}a true phylogenetic
relation. But it is remarkable that we do not find further forms of
development in this family, by multiplication either of the arm-chambers
(further growth in the three perradii) or of the concentric chambered rings
(in the periphery of the disk margin).

The central capsule of the Pylodiscida is constantly flat, discoidal, and
enclosed between the two sieve-plates of the surface.  Its form is either
circular or triangular.

the three arms open.

The genus _Triolena_ is the most simple form of all Pylodiscida, and must
be regarded as their common ancestral form, from an ontogenetic as well as
a phylogenetic point of view. The small shell is composed of a simple,
spherical or lenticular, latticed, central chamber, and of three simple,
surrounding equal arms, which are also simple latticed chambers, lie in the
equatorial plane, and are separated by three equal angles or open gates.

{565}Genus 246. _Triopyle_,[285] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 464.

_Definition._--#Pylodiscida# with a simple, spherical or lenticular,
central chamber, surrounded by three simple arm-chambers. Notches between
the three arms transformed into gates by a connecting equatorial girdle.

The genus _Triopyle_ differs from the preceding _Triolene_ in the
development of a simple ring or latticed equatorial girdle, which connects
the distal ends of the three arm-chambers, and transforms the open notches
between them into three gates. The ring may be circular, triangular, or
hexagonal.


1. _Triopyle circulus_, n. sp.

Disk circular, three times as broad as the hexagonal central chamber. Three

spines (at the end of the arms).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.04, of the gates 0.015.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 274, depth 2750 fathoms.


4. _Triopyle cordigera_, n. sp.

Disk hexagonal, four times as broad as the hexagonal central chamber. Three
arm-chambers triangular, at the base half as broad as at the truncated
distal end, about the same size as the {566}three heart-shaped gates. On
the six corners of the margin (which forms a regular hexagon) are six
pyramidal radial spines, as prolongations of the arm-edges.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.05, of the gates 0.02.

_Habitat._--Indian Ocean, Ceylon, surface, Haeckel.

Disk roundish, triangular, four times as broad as the triangular central
chamber, which is armed with three radial spines between the arms.
Arm-chambers club-shaped, at the narrow base one-fourth, at the distal end
half as broad as the square gates. On the margin twelve large conical
spines, two opposite on each face of the distal end of each arm-edge. Three
smaller radial spines on the three corners of the girdle (in the same
interradial meridian planes as the three spines of the central chamber).
Compare _Triodiscus spinosus_.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.05, of the gates 0.02.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic, Station 332, depth 2200 fathoms.



Genus 247. _Triodiscus_,[286] n. sp.

_Definition._--#Pylodiscida# with a simple, spherical or lenticular,
central chamber, surrounded by three simple arm-chambers. Notches between
the three arms closed by lattice-work and by an equatorial girdle.

The genus _Triodiscus_ differs from the preceding _Triopyle_ in the
development of loose lattice-work on both sides of the discoidal shell.
This network closes the gates and transforms the whole shell into a
fenestrated lens. The singular species of _Triodiscus_ correspond to
certain species of _Triopyle_.


1. _Triodiscus lenticula_, n. sp.

Disk circular, lenticular, three times as broad as the central chamber.
Three arm-chambers trapezoidal, of the same size and form as the three
gates between them, which are closed by a loose {567}delicate network
(differs from _Triopyle circulus_ by the production of the two convex
latticed plates, which envelop the whole lens). Margin smooth.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.045, of the gates 0.015.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 268, depth 2900 fathoms.


2. _Triodiscus trigonus_, n. sp.

Disk triangular, four times as broad as the central chamber. Three
arm-chambers at the base half as broad, at the distal end twice as broad as
the roundish gates. Surface smooth. On the three corners of the margin (in
the arm-radius) three strong spines. (Differs from _Triopyle trigona_ only
in the loose framework closing the gates.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.04, of the gates 0.015.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 272, depth 2600 fathoms.


3. _Triodiscus spinosus_, n. sp. (Pl. 48, fig. 14).

Disk subcircular, four times as broad as the triangular central chamber.
Three arm-chambers club-shaped, at the base one-third, at the distal end
two-thirds as broad as the semicircular gates. Surface thorny. On the
margin fifteen larger radial spines, three on the corners of the disk (in
the radius of the gates), twelve on the two faces of the arms ends (two
opposite on the edge of each end.) (Differs from _Triopyle spinigera_
mainly by the delicate hexagonal network closing the gates.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.05, of the gates 0.02.

_Habitat._--North Atlantic, Canary Islands (Lanzerote, Haeckel).



Subfamily 2. HEXAPYLIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Pylodiscida# with triopyle-shaped medullary shell,
surrounded by three distal arm-chambers, which are separated by three open
notches or gates.



Genus 248. _Pylolena_,[287] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Pylodiscida# with triopyle-shaped medullary shell,
surrounded by three distal arm-chambers. Notches between the three arms
open.

The genus _Pylolena_ opens the series of the Hexapylida, or of those
Pylodiscida in which the centre of the shell is formed by a tri-radiated
medullary shell like _Triopyle_. In the equatorial plane of this
triopyle-shaped disk are developed on its margin three distal arm chambers,
as prolongations of the three arms of _Triopyle_, but much larger. In
_Pylolene_ the three angles or notches between the distal arms remain open,
repeating the form of _Triolene_.


{568}1. _Pylolena inermis_, n. sp.

Arms club-shaped, at the base half as broad, at the rounded distal end as
broad as the triopyle-shaped medullary shell. Surface and margin smooth.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the cortical shell 0.15, of the medullary shell
0.05.

_Habitat._--Equatorial Atlantic, Station 347, surface; Central Pacific,
Station 272, surface.


2. _Pylolena armata_, n. sp. (Pl. 48, fig. 15).

Arms trapezoid, at the base half as broad, at the distal end twice as broad
as the triopyle-shaped medullary shell. Surface and margin thorny. Twelve
strong conical spines at the distal end of the three arms, two opposite on
both faces of the arm-edges.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the cortical shell 0.2, of the medullary shell
0.06.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic, Station 325, surface.



Genus 249. _Hexapyle_,[288] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 464.

_Definition._--#Pylodiscida# with triopyle-shaped medullary shell,
surrounded by three distal arm-chambers. Notches between the three arms
transformed into gates by a connecting equatorial girdle.

The genus _Hexapyle_ differs from the preceding _Pylolene_ in the
development of an equatorial ring or latticed girdle, which connects the
free extremities of the three distal ends and transforms the open notches
between them into gates. It simulates therefore the formation of
_Triopyle_, from which it differs by duplication of the arm-joints and of

Genus 250. _Pylodiscus_,[289] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Pylodiscida# with _Triopyle_-shaped medullary shell,
surrounded by three distal arm-chambers. Notches between the three arms
closed by lattice-work and by an equatorial girdle.

The genus _Pylodiscus_ differs from _Hexapyle_ in the development of two
convex plates of lattice-work, which close the six open gates and transform
the disk into a biconvex fenestrated lens. _Pylodiscus_ simulates therefore
the characteristic form of _Triodiscus_; but whilst in the latter we find
only three arm-joints and three simple gates, their number is doubled in
the former.


1. _Pylodiscus triangularis_, n. sp. (Pl. 48, fig. 17).


Cortical shell triangular, with rounded corners, three times as broad as
the triangular, _Triopyle_-shaped medullary shell. Three arms about as
broad as the three egg-shaped gates between them. (Differs from _Hexapyle
triangula_ only by the delicate network of both triangular convex covering
plates, which close the open gates.) Six larger and many smaller spines on
the margin of the disk.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.15, of the gates 0.05.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 270, depth 2925 fathoms.


2. _Pylodiscus sexangularis_, n. sp.

Cortical shell hexangular, equilateral, four times as broad as the
circular, _Triopyle_-shaped medullary shell. Surface spiny. Three arms
nearly of the same form and size as the three triangular gates between
them. (Similar to _Hexapyle sexangularis_, but differing in the irregular
loose network closing the gates.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.18, of the gates 0.06.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, south of Japan, Station 237, surface


{571}3. _Pylodiscus cardiopylus_, n. sp.

Cortical shell hexangular, equilateral, five times as broad as the
triangular, _Triopyle_-shaped medullary shell. Surface smooth. Three arms
triangular, at the distal end as broad as the three heart-shaped gates. On
the margin six strong pyramidal spines in the equatorial plane (adradial,
as prolongations of the lateral arm-edges).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.15, of the gates 0.05.

_Habitat._--Indian Ocean, Sunda Strait, Rabbe.


4. _Pylodiscus nephropylus_, n. sp.

Cortical shell circular, three times as broad as the circular,
_Triopyle_-shaped medullary shell. Surface spiny. Three arms trapezoidal,
half as broad as the three kidney-shaped gates. On the margin twelve
stronger, conical, radial spines, opposite in pairs on both sides of the
disk, disposed in six pairs at the distal end of the arms.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.2, of the medullary shell 0.06.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 268, depth 2900 fathoms.



Subfamily 3. DISCOPYLIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Pylodiscida# with _Triopyle_-shaped medullary shell and
_Pylodiscus_-shaped cortical shell, which is surrounded by a marginal
chambered equatorial girdle.



Genus 251. _Discozonium_,[290] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Pylodiscida# with _Triopyle_-shaped medullary shell and
_Pylodiscus_-shaped cortical shell, which is surrounded by an equatorial
chambered girdle. No peculiar osculum on the margin of the disk.

The genus _Discozonium_ and the following _Discopyle_ make up together the
small group of the Discopylida, or those Pylodiscida in which a discoidal
shell like _Pylodiscus_ is surrounded by a marginal equatorial girdle; this
girdle is divided into twelve to twenty-four or more chambers by radial
beams, which are the external prolongations of the radial marginal spines
of _Pylodiscus_. The latter genus bears therefore to _Discozonium_ the same
relation as _Sethodiscus_ in the other #Discoidea# does to _Lithocyclia_,
or _Phacodiscus_ to _Coccodiscus_.


1. _Discozonium cyclonium_, n. sp.

Disk circular, lenticular, with smooth margin, three times as broad as the
triangular, _Triopyle_-shaped medullary shell. Three gates of the cortical
shell kidney-shaped, twice as broad as the three {572}arms. Chambered
equatorial girdle with twenty to twenty-four subregular chambers (similar
to _Discopyle osculata_, Pl. 48, fig. 19, but without any marginal
osculum).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.2, of the cortical shell 0.14, of the
medullary shell 0.07.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 265, depth 2900 fathoms.


2. _Discozonium trigonium_, n. sp.

Disk triangular, with thorny margin, four times as broad as the triangular,
_Triopyle_-shaped medullary shell. Three gates of the cortical shell
egg-shaped, scarcely as broad as the three arms. Chambered equatorial
girdle with twenty-four to thirty irregular chambers.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.24, of the cortical shell 0.2, of the
medullary shell 0.06.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 274, depth 2750 fathoms.


3. _Discozonium hexagonium_, n. sp. (Pl. 48, fig. 18).

Disk hexagonal, with spiny margin, four times as broad as the triangular,
_Triopyle_-shaped medullary shell. Three gates of the cortical shell
kidney-shaped, one and a half times as broad as the arms. Chambered
equatorial girdle with twelve large regular chambers; the radial beams
between them are prolonged into twelve strong pyramidal marginal spines
(three perradial on the ends of the arms, three interradial on the radii of
the gates, six adradial between the former and latter).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.2, of the cortical shell 0.12, of the
medullary shell 0.05.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.



Genus 252. _Discopyle_,[291] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Pylodiscida# with _Triopyle_-shaped medullary shell and
_Pylodiscus_-shaped cortical shell, which is surrounded by an equatorial
chambered girdle. One peculiar osculum, surrounded by a corona of spines,
on the margin of the disk.

The genus _Discopyle_ differs from the preceding genus _Discozonium_ in the
development of a peculiar marginal osculum, and bears therefore to it the
same relation as, in the Porodiscida, _Ommatodiscus_ does to _Porodiscus_
(compare above, p. 500). This peculiar osculum is here also surrounded by a
corona of spines, and serves probably for the exit or outlet of a bunch of
pseudopodia or a "sarcode-flagellum." Only two species of _Discopyle_ have
been observed, which represent perhaps better two different genera; in one
species the disk is circular, in the other elliptical. In this latter the
osculum lies on one pole of the main axis.


{573}1. _Discopyle osculata_, n. sp. (Pl. 48, fig. 19).

Disk circular with spiny margin, three times as broad as the triangular,
_Triopyle_-shaped medullary shell. Three gates of the cortical shell
kidney-shaped, on the inside with an interradial spine, twice as broad as
the three pentagonal arms. Chambered equatorial girdle with twenty-four
subregular chambers, in the radius of one odd gate with a large marginal
osculum, which is as broad as the medullary shell, and surrounded by a
dense corona of twenty to thirty strong conical spines.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.15, of the cortical shell 0.1, of the
medullary shell 0.05, of the marginal osculum 0.06.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 272, depth 2600 fathoms.


2. _Discopyle elliptica_, n. sp. (Pl. 48, fig. 20).

Disk elliptical, four-fifths as broad as long, with spiny margin, three
times as broad as the triangular, _Triopyle_-shaped medullary shell. Three
gates of the cortical shell roundish, on the inside with an interradial
spine, little broader than the quadrangular arms. Chambered equatorial
girdle with twenty to thirty irregular chambers, on one pole of the main
axis with a large marginal osculum, which is one-third as broad as the
length of the main axis, and armed with a corona of twenty to thirty short
conical spines.  The osculum does not correspond to a certain radius.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the disk 0.15, of the cortical shell 0.08, of
the medullary shell 0.04, of the marginal osculum 0.05.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 267, depth 2700 fathoms.

      pp. 452, 460, 469.

  _Calodictya_, Ehrenberg, 1847, Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad. d. Wiss.
      Berlin, p. 53 (_partim_).

_Definition._--#Discoidea# without a phacoid shell, with a flat discoidal
shell, in which a simple spherical central chamber is surrounded by an
irregular spongy framework (sometimes with concentric rings around the
central chamber). Surface of the disk quite spongy, without porous
sieve-plates.

The family #Spongodiscida# is the sixth and last family of the #Discoidea#,
and bears to the other families of this group the same relation as the
family Spongosphærida does to the other #Sphæroidea#, or the Spongurida to
the other #Prunoidea#. Its characteristic structure consists in the
irregular spongy framework of the disk, and mainly in the rough, irregular
shape of its spongy surface, which is never covered with porous plates
(neither phacoid shell nor corresponding sieve-plates), as in all other
#Discoidea#.  Of course a little spongy structure occurs also in many
Porodiscida {574}and even in some Coccodiscida (principally in the
peripheral part of the disk or its chambered arms); but both flat (or
convex) surfaces of the disk (at least in the central part) remain here
constantly as simple lattice-plates, whilst in all Spongodiscida the whole
surface of the disk is spongy.

When I constituted the family Spongodiscida in my Monograph (1862, pp. 452,
460) I had separated from them the Spongocyclida, exhibiting in the central
part of the disk a more or less distinct concentric arrangement of the
spongy chambers, whilst in the former the delicate spongy framework is
quite irregular, composed of branched siliceous threads, connected and
interwoven in all directions. But in all Spongocyclida the whole surface of
the spongy disk is quite as irregularly rough and deprived of smooth
sieve-plates as in all true Spongodiscida, and the more or less concentric
structure of the central part of the disk in the former (very variable and
often scarcely able to be recognised) seems not sufficient to separate both
groups; even the single genera cannot be sufficiently separated by this
character. I now therefore give up entirely the group of Spongocyclida (as
already done in my Prodromus, 1881). Nevertheless the concentric annular
structure in the dark central part of some Spongodiscida is very
interesting as transition to the Porodiscida; it indicates already that the
former are derived from the latter.  Even the single genera in both
families are corresponding.

In the new system of "Polycystina," which Ehrenberg gave, 1875 (Abhandl. d.
k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 157), are enumerated under the _Calodictya_
four genera "with spongy disk," viz., _Spongodiscus_, _Rhopalodictyum_,
_Dictyocoryne_, _Spongaster_. Indeed these four genera, which I here
retain, are true Spongodiscida, and must be separated from the other
_Calodictya_, the greater part of which are Porodiscida. The number of
species of true Spongodiscida now amounts to sixty-seven, which I dispose
in thirteen genera.

The whole family may be divided into three subfamilies. The first of these
are the Spongophacida (corresponding to the Trematodiscida among the
Porodiscida), in which the circular margin of the spongy disk bears no
radial appendages; either the margin is quite simple, spongy
(_Spongodiscus_), or surrounded by a hyaline, solid, or porous equatorial
girdle (_Spongophacus_). The disk is either more lenticular (biconvex) or
more flat discoidal (a shortened cylinder), rarely a little biconcave
(thicker at the margin than in the centre). The spongy framework of the
solid disk is either quite irregular (_Spongodisculus_), or in the central
part with concentric circular rings (_Spongocyclia_), or in the central
part spirally convoluted (_Spongospira_).

The second subfamily, Spongotrochida, corresponds to the Stylodictyida
(among the #Porodiscida#), and is distinguished by solid radial spines on
the margin of the disk, disposed in the equatorial plane either irregularly
or regularly (after the same order as in the other families of
#Discoidea#).

The third subfamily, Spongobrachida, correspond perfectly to the
Euchitonida {575}(among the Porodiscida), bearing on the disk-margin two,
three, or four spongy arms, commonly disposed regularly in the equatorial
plane. Here also occurs the peculiar formation of a "patagium," or of an
interbrachial spongy framework different from that of the arms, which
connects the arms like a web-membrane in the equatorial plane.

The spongy framework exhibits in all these Spongodiscida no remarkable
differences, being everywhere composed of fine branched solid siliceous
threads, interwoven in all directions, with irregular meshes of very
different size.

The central capsule of all Spongodiscida is filled up with the same spongy
framework which covers also both its sides. It grows according to the
enveloping skeleton, but remains constantly smaller. The form of the
central capsule is circular (lenticular or discoidal) in the Spongophacida
and Spongotrochida, whilst in the Spongobrachida it enters into the radial
spongy arms, developed from the margin of the spongy disk.

_Definition._--#Spongodiscida# with a simple circular disk, without radial
appendages and without an equatorial girdle on the margin.

The genus _Spongodiscus_ represents the most simple and primitive form of
the Spongodiscida, or of those #Discoidea# in which the central disk is
more or less spongy, composed of an irregular fine framework.  In my
Monograph (1862, pp. 452, 460, 469) I had separated the true _Spongodiscus_
(first described by Ehrenberg, _loc. cit._) and the _Spongocyclia_; the
former being characterised by the irregular spongy framework of the whole
disk, whilst in the latter this framework includes in the central part some
concentric circular rings (approaching _Porodiscus_). In the same way
afterwards Stöhr (1880, _loc. cit._) separated the genus _Spongospira_ as
spongy disks, which include in the central part some spiral convolutions.
But as these differences are rather inconstant and not sharply discernible,
I think it now better to regard these three forms as subgenera of
_Spongodiscus_. All three have the common simple circular disk, without any
marginal appendages.

which surrounds the margin of the disk in the equatorial plane. It
simulates the same formation as _Perichlamydium_ in the Porodiscida, and

the same equatorial plane, whilst in the following genus they are disposed
over the whole surface of the disk. _Stylotrochus_ corresponds to
_Astrocyclia_ among the Coccodiscida, to _Stylodictya_ among the
Porodiscida. The spongy framework of the disk is either quite irregular
(_Stylotrochiscus_), or includes in the middle part some concentric
circular rings (_Stylospongia_).

Genus 260. _Spongolena_,[299] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Spongodiscida# with two opposite spongy arms on the margin
of the disk, without a connecting patagium.

The genus _Spongolena_ opens the series of the Spongobrachida, or of the
Spongodiscida provided with radial spongy arms on the margin of the disk.
_Spongolena_ is the most simple form of this subfamily, and bears only two
simple opposite arms, without a connecting patagium. It corresponds to
_Amphibrachium_ (Porodiscida) and to _Diplactura_ (Coccodiscida). Also
there is no patagium. _Spongolena_ may easily be confounded with
_Spongurus_ (compare my Prodromus, 1881, p. 461); but in the true
_Spongurus_ (an ellipsoid) the transverse section is circular, in
_Spongolena_ elliptical.

bristle-shaped spines on the distal end of the {588}arms. (Very similar to

_Definition._--#Spongodiscida# with two opposite spongy arms on the margin
of the disk, connected by a spongy patagium of different texture.

The genus _Spongobrachium_ differs from the foregoing only in the loose
spongy patagium, which envelops both opposite spongy arms. It corresponds
to _Amphymenium_ among the Porodiscida and to _Amphiactura_ among the
Coccodiscida.

Arms nearly square, scarcely as long and broad as the radius of the
circular central disk, at the broader distal end truncated. Patagium
complete, enveloping the whole disk with the arms, and forming a larger
elliptical disk of looser framework. (In my Monograph, 1862, _loc. cit._, I
had not distinguished the opposite darker arms, opposite in the longer axis
of the elliptical disk, from the enveloping looser framework of the
patagium. In larger specimens of the Challenger collection this distinction
is very evident.)

larger lanceolate disk of looser framework. (Similar in form to
_Amphymenium pupula_, Pl. 44, fig. 8, but with an irregular spongy

Genus 262. _Rhopalodictyum_,[301] Ehrenberg, 1860, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.
Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 830.

_Definition._--#Spongodiscida# with three spongy arms on the margin of the
circular or triangular disk, without a connecting patagium.

The genus _Rhopalodictyum_ comprises those very common forms of
Spongodiscida in which the margin of the disk is provided with three
simple, free, spongy arms. It corresponds to _Dictyastrum_ and
_Rhopalastrum_ among the Porodiscida, to _Trigonactura_ among the
Coccodiscida. The typical species of this genus is _Rhopalodictyum
abyssorum_ of Ehrenberg, the only species figured by him. His diagnosis of
the genus was very insufficient, and agreed with that of his _Dictyastrum_
(compare above the improved diagnosis of this genus, p. 526, and my
Monograph, p. 466).



Subgenus 1. _Rhopalodictya_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Triangular shell regular, with three arms of equal size and
equidistant.

  _Rhopalodictyum abyssorum_, Ehrenberg, 1872, Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d.
  Wiss. Berlin, p. 299, Taf. viii. fig. 17.

Arms of equal size and equidistant, club-shaped, about as long as the
diameter of the triangular central disk, and a little longer than the
breadth of the pear-shaped rounded distal end. Surface rough.

_Dimensions._--Radius of the arms 0.11, basal breadth 0.03, distal breadth
0.06.

_Habitat._--Cosmopolitan; Atlantic, Indian, Pacific; tropical zone,
surface.

  ? _Dictyastrum angulatum_, Ehrenberg, 1872, Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss.
  Berlin, p. 289, Taf. viii. fig. 18.

Arms of equal size and equidistant, nearly square, with straight edges,
towards the truncated end a little broader, about of the same diameter as
the central triangular disk. This species is indicated {590}by Ehrenberg
only by the short diagnosis, "Radiis stellæ tribus apice truncatis." It is
probably identical with his figure of _Dictyastrum angulatum_ (_loc.
cit._). This latter name I have retained for the similar Porodiscid (above,
p. 526), mainly because the genera _Dictyastrum_ and _Rhopalodictyum_,
according to the insufficient diagnosis of Ehrenberg, seem to be identical.
(Compare my Monograph, 1862, p. 466.)

_Dimensions._--Radius of each arm 0.13, basal breadth 0.09, distal breadth
0.1.

_Habitat._--Tropical Pacific, Philippine Sea, Station 200, depth 250
fathoms; Atlantic (Mexican Gulf Stream).

  _Rhopalodictyum subacutum_, Ehrenberg, 1861, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.
  Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 301.

Arms of equal size and equidistant, club-shaped, three times as long as the
diameter of the central disk, which equals the breadth of the thickened
distal end; the latter is armed with a strong pyramidal terminal spine.
(The diagnosis of Ehrenberg is "Radiis stellæ tribus, apice cuneatis
subacutis.")

_Dimensions._--Radius of the arms 0.2, basal breadth 0.04, distal breadth
0.07.

_Habitat._--North Atlantic, surface and various depths; Greenland; Mexican
Gulf Stream; Færöe Channel (John Murray).


4. _Rhopalodictyum bifidum_, n. sp.

Arms of equal size and equidistant, in the distal half forked, twice as
long as the diameter of the central disk; both fork branches half as broad
as the simple basal part, truncated at the distal end.

_Dimensions._--Radius of the arms 0.16, basal breadth 0.08, distal breadth
0.04.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 237, surface.



Subgenus 2. _Triactinosphæra_, Dunikowski, 1882, Denkschr. d. k. Akad. d.
Wiss. Wien, vol. 45, ii. p. 192.

_Definition._--Triangular shell bilateral or irregular, with three arms of
different size or distance.

  _Triactinosphæra zittelii_, Dunikowski, 1882, Denkschr. d. k. Akad. d.
  Wiss, Wien, vol. 45, ii. p. 192.

Arms of different size and at unequal distances, one odd arm being a little
shorter than the two paired arms; the odd angle between the latter is
larger than the paired angles between them and the {591}former. Arms
club-shaped, their basal semi-cylindrical, half as broad as the spherical
distal half, which bears a strong, conical, terminal spine. The discoverer
of this remarkable, very old, Liassic species, Dunikowski, supposes that it
is not a true Discoid, from the absence of a central disk; in my opinion
the central disk (nearly spherical) has the same relation to the arms as in
many other #Discoidea#, their equatorial plane is the same.

_Dimensions._--Radius of the odd arm 0.18, of the paired arms 0.24; basal
breadth 0.08, distal breadth 0.16.

_Habitat._--Fossil in the Alpine Lias, Schafberg, near Salzburg,
Dunikowski.


6. _Rhopalodictyum elongatum_, n. sp.

Arms of different size and at unequal distances, one odd arm being twice as
long as both paired arms; the odd angle between the latter much larger than
both equal paired angles. Arms nearly cylindrical, little flattened, three
to six times as long as broad, with rounded blunt distal end.

_Dimensions._--Radius of the arms 0.15 to 0.3, breadth 0.05.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 274, surface.


7. _Rhopalodictyum curvatum_, n. sp.

Arms of different size and at unequal distances, irregular, more or less
curved, nearly cylindrical, five to ten times as long as broad, with
rounded blunt distal end. (There were observed only two specimens of this
remarkable irregular species; in one specimen all three arms were simple,
in the other one odd arm forked. The length of the arms and the size of the
angles between them seems to be very different and variable.)

_Dimensions._--Radius of the arms 0.3 to 0.6 to 1.15, breadth 0.06 to 0.12.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 271, surface.



Genus 263. _Dictyocoryne_,[302] Ehrenberg, 1860, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.
Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 830.

_Definition._--#Spongodiscida# with three spongy arms on the margin of the
circular or triangular disk, connected by a spongy patagium of different
texture.

The genus _Dictyocoryne_ differs from the foregoing _Rhopalodictyum_ only
in the patagium, connecting the three spongy arms, and bears to it the same
relation as in the Porodiscida _Euchitonia_ does to _Rhopalastrum_. The
typical species of this genus is _Dictyocoryne profunda_, the only species
figured by Ehrenberg. After his {592}insufficient diagnosis _Dictyocoryne_
was identical with his _Spongaster_ (compare my Monograph, p. 467); but as
the type of this latter genus (_Spongaster tetras_) figured by him, 1872,
had four crossed arms, we retain this genus here separate.

Genus 265. _Spongaster_,[304] Ehrenberg, 1860, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.

_Definition._--#Spongodiscida# with four spongy arms on the margin of the
circular or quadrangular disk, connected by a spongy patagium of different
texture.

The genus _Spongaster_ differs from the foregoing _Spongasteriscus_ in the
patagium connecting the spongy arms, and bears therefore to it the same
relation as, in the Porodiscida, _Histiastrum_ does to _Stauralastrum_, or,
in the Coccodiscida, _Stauractura_ does to _Astractura_. The typical
specimen, figured by Ehrenberg (_Spongaster tetras_), exhibits a regular,
square disk, as also some other species. In a certain number of other
species (formerly united by me with _Spongocyclia_) the quadrangular disk
is bilateral.

papiliocross, club-shaped, about twice as long as the diameter of the
square central disk and eight times as long as broad at their base. Distal
ends rounded, perfectly enclosed by the complete patagium, which forms a
regular square, with slightly concave sides.

_Dimensions._--Radius of the arms 0.12, distal breadth 0.03, basal breadth
0.015; length of the square side 0.2.

about four times as long as the diameter of the central circular disk, and
five times as long as broad at the base. Basal third of the arms square;
distal two thirds triangular, three times as broad, with a truncated distal
end. Patagium complete, perfectly enveloping the arms, and bordered by an
elegant, radially striated, broad edge, forming a regular square. (Similar
to _Histiastrum quadratum_, Pl. 46, fig. 4, but quite spongy.)

{598}4. _Spongaster pentacyclus_, n. sp.

Arms at equal distances, forming a rectangular, regular cross, of the same
size and form as the circular central disk, so that the dark interior part
of the shell is composed of five equal circular disks, situated in a
quincuncial manner. The clearer complete patagium, enveloping the whole
cross perfectly, forms a regular square with rounded edges.

Suborder VI. LARCOIDEA, Haeckel, 1883 (Pls. 9, 10, 49, 50).

_Definition_.--SPUMELLARIA with lentelliptical central capsule (rarely
somewhat modified or allomorphic), with a lentelliptical fenestrated
siliceous shell (often modified or allomorphic, and sometimes quite
irregular). Growth different in the three unequal dimensive axes,
perpendicular one to another. The typical Lentellipsis is characterised by
three elliptical dimensive planes of different sizes, perpendicular one to
another.

The section #Larcoidea#, the fourth and last of the #Sphærellaria#,
comprises all those forms of this group in which the fenestrated shell
originally is lentelliptical, characterised by different growth in three
different axes, perpendicular one to another, all three equal on both
poles. The geometrical fundamental form of the shell is therefore a
lentellipsis or a triaxial ellipsoid; and this typical form is preserved
completely in the majority of #Larcoidea# in the pure geometrical form of
the central capsule.

The three dimensive axes, which determine the typical form of #Larcoidea#,
are commonly differentiated in such a way, that the first, the longitudinal
or principal axis, is the longest; both its poles, oral and aboral (or
anterior and posterior) are equal. The second, the lateral or transverse
axis, is commonly less than the first, greater than the third axis; both
its poles are the equal lateral poles (right and left not differentiated).
The third dimensive axis, the equatorial or sagittal axis, is commonly the
shortest; both its equal poles are the sagittal poles (dorsal and ventral
poles not different). The relative size of the three dimensive axes in the
human body exhibits similar relations.

The three dimensive planes of the #Larcoidea#, the sagittal, lateral, and
transverse planes, are elliptical, all three of different sizes. The first
plane, the median or sagittal plane, is commonly as regards size between
the two others; its major axis is the principal, its minor the sagittal
axis; it separates the right half of the body from the left. The second
plane or lateral plane, is commonly larger than the two others; its major
axis the principal, its minor the transverse axis; it separates the dorsal
half of the body from the ventral. The third plane, the equatorial or zonal
plane, is commonly less than the two others; its major axis the lateral,
its minor the sagittal axis; it separates the two principal halves of the
body, the oral and aboral halves.

In my Monograph (1862) only very few forms of #Larcoidea# are described,
_Tetrapyle_ and _Lithelius_ (the latter representing a peculiar family,
Lithelida). In my Prodromus (1881, pp. 463, 464) I disposed all observed
forms of #Larcoidea# in two different families, the Pylonida and Lithelida.
The rich materials of the Challenger collection have since offered an
astonishing number of new and interesting forms of this section, so that I
can enumerate here fifty-one genera and two hundred and sixty-five species.
I dispose them here in four subsections and nine families. Three of these
have regular lentelliptical shells, which are not articulate, and
{600}without annular constrictions (Larcarida, Larnacida, Pylonida); these
form the subsection Pylolarcida. Two other families (Tholonida and
Zonarida) are distinguished by annular constrictions, which divide the
regular lentelliptical shell into a number of dome-shaped chambers or
cupolas; we call these Thololarcida. A third group, Spirolarcida, comprises
the #Larcoidea# with spiral growth; the two families of Lithelida and
Streblemida. Finally a fourth group the Sorolarcida is formed by the
#Larcoidea# with irregular shells, also two families, the Phorticida and
Soreumida.

The first family of #Larcoidea#, the Larcarida, contains the most simple
forms, beginning with _Cenolarcus_, a quite simple lentelliptical latticed
shell. In _Coccolarcus_ we find already two concentric shells, connected by
radial beams, an inner medullary and an outer cortical shell. In
_Spongolarcus_ the lentelliptical shell becomes spongy.

The second family, Larnacida, is very similar to the Larcarida, and seems
to diverge only by the different mode of connection between the two
concentric lentelliptical shells. But in truth this slight difference is of
great morphological importance, as it depends on a quite different and
peculiar mode of growth. In the foregoing Larcarida (_Coccolarcus_, &c.),
the concentric shells originate in the same manner as in the concentric
#Prunoidea# and #Sphæroidea#, by radial beams, which arise from the surface
of the inner (medullary) shell and become connected by a network to form
the outer (cortical) shell. Here, in the Larnacida, a quite similar shell
originates in a quite different way, first arrived at in the Pylonida
(_Trizonium_). Both concentric shells become here connected by peculiar
lattice girdles, which are developed in the perimeter of the three
elliptical dimensive planes. Firstly, on both sides of a simple, spherical,
or lentelliptical central chamber, arise two lateral wings (on the poles of
the transverse axis), and build around the former a transverse girdle. This
is crossed by a larger lateral girdle, the minor axis of which is the major
of the former, and perpendicular to both girdles is yet developed a third,
the sagittal girdle. If the open fissures or "gates" between these three
girdles become closed by network, we obtain _Larnacilla_, the probable
ancestral form of all Larnacida.

Whilst in _Larnacilla_ and _Larnacidium_ this typical trizonal
lentelliptical shell constitutes by itself alone the whole skeleton, in the
other Larnacida it becomes overgrown by outer envelops, and so becomes
enclosed in the interior of the central capsule as a "_Larnacilla_-shaped
medullary shell." If the enclosing external envelops be simply latticed, we
get the subfamily Larnacalpida; if they be spongy, we get the
Larnacospongida.

The third family, Pylonida, is the most important of all #Larcoidea#, as
not only the largest and most interesting number of species belong to it,
but also many other genera (far the greater part of all #Larcoidea#) may be
derived from it. The peculiar character of the Pylonida is determined by
the imperfect fenestration of the lentelliptical shell growing in the three
dimensive axes in a quite different manner. Each elliptical dimensive plane
becomes circumscribed by an elliptical latticed girdle (or fenestrated
{601}ring), and between these three girdles (perpendicular one to another)
remain wide open fissures of the shell or "gates" (_Pylæ_). The beginning
of the shell-building is the same as in _Larnacilla_, the most simple form
of Larnacida. From a quite simple medullary shell, a spherical,
subspherical, ellipsoidal, or lentelliptical central chamber, arise two
latticed wings, opposite on the poles of the transverse axis
(_Monozonium_). Both wings are short and wide hollow fenestrated tubes, the
axes of which are parallel to the principal axis. Therefore they form
together with the central chamber an elliptical transverse girdle. This
first girdle becomes crossed by a second lateral girdle; from both poles of
the transverse axis arise latticed wings, which unite on the poles of the
principal axis, therefore the minor axis of this second larger ring is the
major axis of the first smaller ring (_Dizonium_). Between the two crossed
rings remain four wide open gates. Now follows the development of a third
sagittal girdle, arising from both poles of the principal axis and
overgrowing the four gates. But as this third girdle is larger than the
second, four other larger gates arise between the two (in planes
perpendicular to the former four gates). Now we have the characteristic and
most important trizonal shell (_Trizonium_), composed of three elliptical
lattice-girdles of different size, perpendicular one to another, and
enclosing a simple central chamber. If the four gates of this _Trizonium_
become closed by lattice-work, it passes over into _Larnacilla_, the most
important ancestral form of the Larnacida.

This most significant "trizonal shell," either incompletely latticed in
_Trizonium_ (with four open gates), or completely latticed by fenestration
of the four gates, in _Larnacilla_, is to be found in far the greater part
of all #Larcoidea#, representing the medullary shell, which is overgrown by
an outer cortical shell. In many #Larcoidea#, in which this
"_Larnacilla_-shell" is absent, it is perhaps lost  by phylogenetic
reduction, or retrograde metamorphosis.

The same process of triple girdle-building, by which the typical
_Trizonium_-shell or _Larnacilla_-shell is produced (Haplozonaria), is
repeated once or twice in the larger forms of Pylonida. The first system of
three girdles (perpendicular one to another) becomes overgrown by a second
system of the same formulation in the Diplozonaria, and this becomes
overgrown by a third system in the Triplozonaria; in the highest genus of
this group, _Pylozonium_, we find not less than nine girdles (three
systems, each of three girdles). Till now only one genus of the whole
polymorphous family was well known, _Tetrapyle_ (with five girdles, three
of the medullary, two of the cortical shell). If the gates between the
girdles remain open, all these forms must be regarded as Pylonida; if the
gates afterwards become closed by a network, they pass over into other
families.

The fourth family of the _Larcoidea_ is the Tholonida, distinguished by the
polythalamous shell being composed of a certain number of roundish or
hemispherical chambers (domes or cupolas), which surround a primordial
central chamber in quite regular disposition, lying opposite in pairs on
the poles of the three dimensive axes. {602}If we imagine that each "wing"
(or open half-girdle) of the Pylonida becomes closed by a lattice-work, and
so transformed into a hemispherical or roundish cupola, we obtain the
characteristic shell of the Tholonida. Indeed every girdle of the former
corresponds to a pair of opposite domes of the latter. The axis of each
pair of domes is one of the three dimensive axes.

The primordial chamber of the Tholonida (or the central chamber, around
which all cupolas are regularly disposed) is either a simple lentelliptical
lattice-shell, like _Cenolarcus_, or it is a trizonal shell (with an
enclosed concentric medullary shell), like _Larnacilla_. As in both cases
the building and the disposition of the cupolas around it are quite the
same, we can suppose that the whole family of Tholonida may have been
derived originally from _Larnacilla_ (or _Trizonium_), and that the
Cenotholida (with a simple central chamber) are sprung from the
Coccotholida (with a _Larnacilla_-shaped central chamber) by reduction and
loss of the original medullary shell.

The family Tholonida can be divided into three subfamilies according to the
disposition of the cupola-pairs in one, two, or three dimensive axes. In
the Cubotholida lie two cupolas on the poles of the transverse axis of the
central chamber (corresponding to _Amphipyle_); in the Staurotholida we
find four cupolas crosswise disposed, on the poles of the transverse and
principal axes (corresponding to _Tetrapyle_); in the Cubotholida are at
least six cupolas, on the poles of all three dimensive axes (corresponding
to _Tholonium_). In all three cases the number of cupolas may be augmented
by the secondary apposition of other chambers or domes in the same
disposition. Sometimes also the whole cortical shell becomes enclosed by an
external veil or mantle of delicate network. The lentelliptical (or often
nearly cubical) central chamber becomes often reduced, so that its sides
are incompletely latticed or widely opened; in some Cubotholida only the
twelve edges of the eight cornered cubical central chamber remain; its six
sides are quite open and only over-vaulted by the six hemispherical
cupolas. From the opposite points of the latter (in the deep annular
constrictions between them) often arise radial spines, and these lie
commonly in diagonal planes, separating the dome-pairs.

A similar dome-building or a composition of the polythalamous shell by
pairs of cupolas we find also in the next (fifth) family, the Zonarida. But
here the true cause of the peculiar dome-structure is quite different, not
an apposition of new chambers, but the constriction of a cortical
shell-like _Larnacalpis_ by two or more constrictions. These constrictions
lie in dimensive planes (or in planes parallel to these), and therefore the
cupolas are (all or partly) in diagonal planes, a condition quite opposite
to that found in the Tholonida. One of the annular constrictions is
constantly in the sagittal plane (separating the right and left halves of
the shell). The number of the constrictions in the few genera is two,
three, and four, and therefore the number of the cupolas four, six, or
eight. As this cortical shell constantly encloses a trizonal medullary
shell (or _Larnacilla_-shell), we cannot doubt that the Zonarida must be
derived from the Larnacida.

{603}Whilst in all the foregoing five families of #Larcoidea# the
shell-form is regular and their geometrical fundamental form is a
lentellipsis (or a triaxial ellipsoid, with three unequal isopolar
dimensive axes), in the four remaining families of this suborder the shell
becomes bilateral or irregular (with the poles of the axes unequal). In two
of these families (Lithelida and Streblemida) the growth of the shell
becomes spiral, in the last two families (Soreumida and Phorticida) quite
irregular. But as in all four families we encounter the typical trizonal
medullary shell (or _Larnacilla_-shell), we are convinced that they must be
derived (wholly or partially) from the Larnacida.

The Lithelida (the sixth family) are #Larcoidea# with spiral growth and
bilateral form (like _Nautilus_); therefore the spiral line lies in one
plane and this spiral plane divides the whole shell into two symmetrical
halves (right and left). The axis of the spiral (around which the shell
winds) is a straight line, one of the three dimensive axes. In the greater
part of Lithelida (in the Larcospirida) the primordial of central chamber
of the polythalamous shell is a trizonal medullary shell or
_Larnacilla_-shell, and the growth of the first spiral turning begins as
the development of the first (transverse) cortical girdle of _Amphipyle_;
but as one wing (or lateral half) of this girdle grows more rapidly than
the other, it overgrows the latter and begins the spiral winding; if the
other wing follow and overgrow the first, the spiral becomes double. Each
of the three dimensive girdles (of the Pylonida) may begin the spiral
winding. There can be no doubt that all these Lithelida (the Larcospirida)
must be derived from the Pylonida, by unequal growth of the two halves of
one girdle. Perhaps from these may also derived the other part of this
family, the Spiremida (_Spirema_ and _Lithelius_); in these the primordial
chamber of the spiral shell is simple, and may be derived by reduction of
the original _Larnacilla_-shell. But it is also possible that the Spiremida
proceed directly from the Larcarida, and that their ancestors did not
possess a _Larnacilla_-shell.

The Streblemida (the seventh family) are #Larcoidea# with spiral growth and
asymmetrical form of the polythalamous shell (like _Helix_ or
_Turrilites_); therefore the spiral line is twisted like a winding stair,
and the spiral face is curved and divides the shell into two unequal
halves. The Streblemida have the same likeness and relation to the
turbinoid Foraminifera (_Rotalia_, _Globigerina_, &c.) as the Lithelida to
the nautiloid Foraminifera (_Polystomella_, _Nummulina_, &c.). As in these
calcareous Rhizopods also the peculiar growth of the siliceous Streblemida
begins from a primordial chamber to which a variable number of roundish
chambers (of increasing size) is apposed. But the building of these
chambers and of their septa is by no means so regular and complete as in
the greater number of turbinoid Foraminifera. As in a part of this family
the primordial chamber is _Larnacilla_-shell, these also may be derived
from the Larnacida, but the other part (with simple central chamber) is
perhaps produced directly from the Larcarida.

The eighth family, Soreumida, is perhaps derived from the Streblemida by
the loss of the spiral growth. The polythalamous shell is similar to the
latter, but the chambers are {604}aggregated without any order, like the
Acervulinida among the Foraminifera. In some cases also here the primordial
chamber is a trizonal _Larnacilla_-shell, in other cases it is a simple,
subspherical or lentelliptical shell.

The last family, the Phorticida, is formed of irregular #Larcoidea#, in
which a lentelliptical trizonal _Larnacilla_-shell (as an inner medullary
shell) is enveloped by an irregular, latticed, or spongy cortical shell.
They can be regarded as abnormalities or irregular deformities of Larnacida
or Pylonida.

The central capsule of the #Larcoidea# is originally lentelliptical and
preserves this form, the "triaxial ellipsoid," in the greater number of
genera. In some groups it follows the prevalent growth of the shell in the
direction of one of the three dimensive axes, and becomes prolonged in this
way. In many chambered forms (particularly Tholonida and Zonarida) the
growing central capsule gets constricted, corresponding to the
constrictions of the shell. In the Soreumida and Phorticida its form often
becomes irregular. But in general for the greater number of #Larcoidea# the
lentelliptical form of their central capsule is quite characteristic.

{605}Family XXIV. #LARCARIDA#, Haeckel, 1883 (Pl. 50, figs. 1, 2).

_Definition._--#Larcoidea# with a regular, completely latticed,
lentelliptical cortical shell, without open gates and annular
constrictions; medullary shell absent or simple (not trizonal), connected
with the cortical shell by radial beams.

The family #Larcarida# opens the long series of #Larcoidea# as the most
simple group of this suborder. It commences with _Cenolarcus_, a quite
simple lentelliptical latticed shell, which is characterised by three
unequal isopolar dimensive axes, perpendicular one to another. The major of
these three axes is the longitudinal or principal, the middle is the
lateral or transverse, and the minor is the equatorial or sagittal axis (as
in the human body). Among the three dimensive planes, which are determined
by pairs of these axes, the lateral plane is the largest (halved by the
crossed principal and lateral axes). The intermediate is the sagittal plane
or median plane (halved by the crossed principal and sagittal axes). The
smallest is the equatorial plane or transverse plane (halved by the crossed
lateral and sagittal axes). Therefore the shell has all the characters of
the true _Lentellipsis_ or of the "triaxial ellipsoid," and its axes agree
with the three axes of the "rhombic crystalline system."

In the three subfamilies of Larcarida this lentelliptical shell assumes a
different shape: in the Cenolarcida it remains simple, in the Spongolarcida
it becomes spongy (sometimes quite filled out with a spongy framework), in
the Coccolarcida it is composed of two or more concentric lentelliptical
shells (at least an inner medullary and one outer cortical shell). These
shells are simply connected by radial beams, and not, as in the Larnacida,
by latticed wings (or half girdles).

The network of the Larcarida shell is sometimes regular, commonly irregular
(as in the greater number of #Larcoidea#). The surface of the shell is
sometimes smooth or thorny, at other times covered with radial spines.
These are often symmetrically disposed, either on the poles of the
dimensive axes or in crossed diagonal planes.

The central capsule is a true "lentellipsis" in a geometrical sense; it is
halved by three elliptical dimensive planes of different sizes,
perpendicular one to another. In the Cenolarcida the central capsule lies
freely inside the simple (cortical) shell, only separated from it by the
jelly-mantle. In the Coccolarcida it contains the medullary shell, and is
enclosed by the simple or double cortical shell, perforated by the radial
beams connecting the two shells. The spongy shell of the Spongolarcida
exhibits a different relation to the central capsule: in _Spongolarcus_ the
latter lies freely in the internal cavity of the spongy shell; in
_Stypolarcus_, where this cavity is quite filled with a spongy network, the
central capsule also contains a part of it.

The morphological and phylogenetic relations of the Larcarida to the other
families of SPUMELLARIA admit of a different explanation. As this family
contains the {606}most simple forms of all #Larcoidea#, we can regard the
_Cenolarcus_ as the common ancestral form of this group, having originated
from _Actilarcus_ (or the lentelliptical _Actissa_) by the building of a
simple lentelliptical lattice-shell. But it is also possible that a part of
the Larcarida (or all?) descend from Larnacida by reduction or loss of the
original _Larnacilla_-shell (compare _Cenolarcus triaxonius_, p. 607).

form of this suborder. It corresponds to _Cenosphæra_ among the
#Sphæroidea#, to _Cenodiscus_ among the #Discoidea#, to _Cenellipsis_ among
the #Prunoidea#. The simple latticed shell is distinguished from that of
the three other genera by its typical lentelliptical form, a triaxial
ellipsoid with three dimensive axes of unequal length. Probably
_Cenolarcus_ is the original ancestral form of the #Larcoidea#, derived
from _Actilarcus_ (the lentelliptical _Actissa_) by the formation of a
simple fenestrated shell around the lentelliptical central capsule. But
possibly also some species of _Cenolarcus_ may be derived from
_Coccolarcus_ or _Larnacilla_ by reduction and loss of the medullary shell
(compare _Cenolarcus triaxonius_, n. sp.).

_Definition._--#Larcarida# with a simple, lentelliptical latticed shell,
without a medullary shell; surface covered with radial spines.

The genus _Larcarium_ differs from _Cenolarcus_ only in the possession of
radial spines on the surface of the simple fenestrated lentelliptical
shell. These spines are commonly disposed symmetrically, opposite in pairs,
either on the poles of the three dimensive axes, or on the poles of certain
diagonal axes. Larcarium differs from the similar genera _Larcidium_,
_Larnacidium_, and _Larnacantha_ by the absence of any medullary shell.

Subfamily 2. COCCOLARCIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Larcarida# with encased lentelliptical shell, composed of
two or more concentric lentelliptical latticed shells, which are united by
radial beams (at least one inner medullary shell and one outer cortical
shell).



Genus 268. _Coccolarcus_,[307] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Larcarida# with two concentric latticed shells, an outer
lentelliptical cortical shell, and an inner (spherical or lentelliptical)
medullary shell, both connected by radial beams. Surface without radial
spines.

The genus _Coccolarcus_ differs from _Cenolarcus_ by the possession of an
internal medullary shell. This is quite simple, either spherical or
lentelliptical, and connected with the outer cortical shell by a number of
radial beams. In the similar _Larnacilla_ this connection is effected by
four internal latticed lamellæ (the half lateral wings of the transverse
girdle); therefore we find here four internal gates (on the poles of the
principal axis), absent in _Coccolarcus_.

_Definition._--#Larcarida# with two concentric latticed shells, an outer
lentelliptical cortical shell, and an inner (spherical or lentelliptical)
medullary shell, both connected by radial beams. Surface covered with
radial spines.

The genus _Larcidium_ differs from the foregoing _Coccolarcus_ only in the
possession of radial spines, and bears to it the same relation that
_Larcarium_ does to _Cenolarcus_. The spines are commonly symmetrically
disposed, opposite in pairs in the dimensive axes, sometimes also in
diagonal axes.


1. _Larcidium dissacanthum_, n. sp.

Cortical shell with thorny surface and regular network; pores circular,
hexagonally framed, three times as broad as the bars; about thirteen on the

principal axis, and prolonged on its poles into two strong conical spines,
somewhat longer than the greatest axis.

0.025.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 253, depth 3125 fathoms.


2. _Larcidium hexacanthum_, n. sp.

Cortical shell with smooth surface and regular network; pores circular,
twice as broad as the bars; about eleven on the half meridian, nine on the
half equator. Proportion of the three axes = 2 : 2.5 : 3. Medullary shell
spherical, one-third as broad as the cortical. On the surface six strong,
three-sided pyramidal spines, all about as long as the breadth of the
cortical shell.

half meridian, twelve to fourteen on the half {612}equator. Proportion of
the three axes = 2 : 3 : 4. Medullary shell lentelliptical, of the same
form and structure as the cortical, but only one-third as large, connected
with it by six thin radial beams, lying in pairs in the three dimensive
axes; on the outside they are prolonged into six strong conical radial
spines, which are in pairs of different size (as in _Larcarium axostylum_);
the length of each spine nearly equals the axis of the cortical shell, of
which it is the prolongation.

Cortical shell thorny, with irregular network; pores roundish, once to four
times as broad as the bars; about thirteen to fifteen on the half meridian,
eleven to thirteen on the half equator. Proportion of the three axes =

_Tetrapyle octacantha_.

_Definition._--#Larcarida# with lentelliptical spongy shell, containing a
central cavity of the same form, without medullary shell (without radial
spines).

The genus _Spongolarcus_ differs from _Cenolarcus_ (its probable ancestral
form) only in the development of spongy framework forming the wall of the
hollow lentelliptical shell. It corresponds, therefore, to _Plegmosphæra_
among the #Sphæroidea#, and to _Spongellipsis_ among the #Prunoidea#. From
these two similar spongy #Sphærellaria# it differs in its characteristic
lentelliptical form, with three dimensive axes of unequal length.


1. _Spongolarcus lentellipsis_, n. sp.

Spongy network of the shell very loose, its meshes fifteen to twenty times
as broad as the bars. Surface of the shell nearly smooth; diameter of its
internal cavity twice as large as the thickness of its wall. Proportion of
the three dimensive axes = 2 : 3 : 4.

_Definition._--#Larcarida# with lentelliptical spongy shell, composed of
compact spongy framework, without central cavity and medullary shell
(without radial spines).

The genus _Stypolarcus_ differs from _Spongolarcus_ in the absence of any
central cavity. This is quite filled up by spongy framework, which forms
the whole mass of the lentelliptical body. _Stypolarcus_ bears therefore
the same relation to _Spongolarcus_ that _Styptosphæra_ does to
_Plegmosphæra_.

Family XXV. #LARNACIDA#, Haeckel, 1883 (Pl. 50, figs. 3-8).

_Definition._--#Larcoidea# with a regular, completely latticed,
lentelliptical cortical shell, without open gates and annular
constrictions; either this cortical shell or the enclosed medullary shell
is trizonal, composed of three elliptical, latticed, dimensive girdles of
different sizes, perpendicular one to another.

{615}The family #Larnacida# immediately follows the Larcarida as the next
simple group of all #Larcoidea#; some genera of both groups (such as
_Larnacalpis_ and _Coccolarcus_, or _Larnacantha_ and _Larcidium_) may
easily be confounded from their being so much alike. In both the
lentelliptical shell is composed of two concentric shells, an inner
(medullary) and an outer (cortical) shell. But the connection between these
shells and the construction of the inner shell is quite different in the
two groups. Whilst in the Larcarida the medullary shell is connected with
the cortical shell simply by radial beams, here in the Larnacida this
connection is effected by two latticed lamellæ, which are the lateral wings
of a transverse girdle. Therefore we encounter here for the first time that
peculiar mode of growth which characterises the greater part of the
#Larcoidea#, but particularly the Pylonida. But whilst in the Pylonida
between the three crossed lattice-girdles, remain four open gates, here in
the Larnacida the gates become closed by lattice-work; the lentelliptical
cortical shell becomes perfect.

The most simple genus of Larnacida, and no doubt the common ancestral form
of this whole family, is _Larnacilla_ (Pl. 50, figs. 1, 1_a_, 1_b_). The
most important shell of this typical genus is composed of a simple
lentelliptical medullary shell and of three elliptical latticed girdles
surrounding it, perpendicular one to another. These three "dimensive
girdles" lie in the perimeter of the three dimensive planes, the minor (and
first) in the equatorial plane, the second (and major) in the lateral
plane, the third (and intermediate) in the sagittal plane. Therefore we
have before us the same "trizonal shell" as in the important genus
_Trizonium_ among the Pylonida. But whilst in _Trizonium_, as in all
Pylonida, the four gates between the girdles remain open, here in
_Larnacilla_ they become perfectly closed by lattice-work.

The formation of the typical "_Larnacilla_-shell" begins with a simple,
spherical or lentelliptical lattice-shell, from both sides of which arise
two latticed "lateral wings" opposite on the poles of the transverse axis.
These two wings are comparable to the lateral chambers of _Tholartus_
(among the Tholonida), but differ by two large openings. Each wing is a
short cylindrical tube with latticed wall, open at both ends; the axis of
the tube (going through the centre of the open ends) is parallel to the
principal axis of the whole shell (and of the central chamber). Therefore
both wings form together a transverse ring, the middle of which encloses
the central chamber. The distal parts of both wings grow towards the poles
of the principal axis; if they became united here, the second (lateral)
girdle would be complete. Between it and the first girdle four open gates
remain ("_Tetrapyle_"); but these become overgrown by the third or sagittal
girdle, and at last the gates between this and the two other girdles become
closed by lattice-work. This perfect fenestration of the trizonal cortical
shell, and the complete closing of the gates between the girdles by
network, is the only difference between _Trizonium_ and _Larnacilla_.

In _Larnacilla_ and in the nearly allied _Larnacidium_ (only differing by
radial spines {616}on the surface) the "trizonal shell" is an external or
"cortical shell," enclosing the central capsule, the interior of which only
contains the simple central chamber and the jointed proximal parts of both
lateral wings. In the other genera of Larnacida (by proceeding growth) this
trizonal _Larnacilla_-shell becomes enclosed by the growing central capsule
and is now only a "medullary shell," whilst on the outside of the central
capsule in the same manner is developed an outer cortical shell
(_Larnacalpis_, _Larnacantha_); and perhaps the same process may be
repeated. But sometimes also this cortical shell becomes doubled by a
simple envelop of network (_Larnacoma_). In the Larnacospongida the
cortical shell is composed of a spongy framework (corresponding to the
Spongolarcida in the foregoing family).

The lattice-work of the Larnacida is commonly irregular (as in most other
#Larcoidea#), and its pores have little signification for the different
species. On the outer surface often arise radial spines, symmetrically
disposed either in dimensive planes or in diagonal planes.

The central capsule is constantly a true lentellipsis or a "triaxial
ellipsoid," characterised by three halving, elliptical dimensive planes,
perpendicular one to another. It bears a different relation to the skeleton
in the two subfamilies of Larnacida. In the first subfamily, the
Larnacillida (_Larnacilla_, _Larnacidium_), the central capsule encloses
only the simple spherical or lentelliptical central chamber ("simple
medullary shell"), and is enveloped by the trizonal cortical shell. In the
other subfamily, the Larnacalpida (_Larnacalpis_, _Larnacospongus_, &c.),
this trizonal "_Larnacilla_-shell" becomes enclosed by the overgrowing
central capsule, which now becomes enveloped by an external, latticed or
spongy, lentelliptical "cortical shell."

{617}Subfamily 1. LARNACILLIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Larnacida# with a simple, spherical or lentelliptical,
medullary shell, connected by the lateral wings of a latticed transverse
girdle with the simple lentelliptical trizonal cortical shell; the central
capsule encloses the former and is enveloped by the latter.



Genus 272. _Larnacilla_,[311] n. gen.


_Definition._--#Larnacida# with a simple lentelliptical cortical shell,
connected by the lateral wings of a latticed transverse girdle with the
simple, spherical or lentelliptical, medullary shell. Surface without
radial spines.

The genus _Larnacilla_ represents the most simple form of Larnacida, and at
the same time the most important common ancestral form, from which the
greater number of #Larcoidea# may be derived, viz., all those genera which
possess  the characteristic "_Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell." This
typical form of medullary shell may be derived from the genus _Trizonium_
among the Pylonida by the closing of the four open gates of this genus. The
free opening of these four gates becomes overgrown and closed by
lattice-work, developed from the free edges of the three crossed girdles,
and thus finally all three girdles are united in the form of a simple
lentelliptical shell (Pl. 50, figs. 1, 1_a_, 1_b_). Seen from the sagittal
poles (or from the poles of the shortest axis, fig. 1), the shell exhibits
on both sides of the small spherical medullary shell the two lateral wings
of the transverse girdle from the face; seen from the lateral poles (or
from the poles of the transverse axis, fig. 1_a_), one of these wings
appears in the optical section as an oblong ring, which seemingly encloses
the concentric medullary shell, and on both sides is grown together with
the sagittal girdle; seen from the principal poles (or from the poles of
the longitudinal axis, fig. 1_b_), both wings exhibit their elliptical
opening (at the right and left from the central medullary shell). The two
concentric shells are only connected by the two lateral tube-like wings of
the transverse girdle; the lateral and the sagittal girdles have no
connection with the medullary shell. The latter is sometimes spherical, at
other times lentelliptical.

connected by the lateral wings of a latticed transverse girdle with the
simple, spherical or lentelliptical, medullary shell. Surface armed with
radial spines.

{619}The genus _Larnacidium_ has the same shell-formation as the foregoing
_Larnacilla_, and differs from it only in the possession of radial spines
on the surface, which in all known species exhibit a symmetrical
disposition. From the nearly allied genus _Larcidium_ it differs in the
characteristic mode of connection between the two shells, owing to the
different kind of growth. In _Larcidium_ this connection is effected only
by radial beams, whereas in _Larnacidium_ (as in all Larnacida) by two
lateral latticed tubes, the wings of the primary transverse girdle.

thin radial spines, about as long as the shell. Pores irregular, twice to
five times as broad as the bars; about sixteen on the half meridian.

Subfamily 2. LARNACALPIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Larnacida# with a double, trizonal, _Larnacilla_-shaped
medullary shell, enclosed in the central capsule, and enveloped by a simple
or double, latticed or spongy, lentelliptical, cortical shell.



{620}Genus 274. _Larnacalpis_,[313] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Larnacida# with a simple lentelliptical cortical shell,
without radial spines. Medullary shell double, _Larnacilla_-shaped.

The genus _Larnacalpis_ represents the most simple form of the sub-family
Larnacalpida, and is very important as the common original form of all
those #Larcoidea# in which a double _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell is
surrounded by a simple, perfectly closed, latticed, lentelliptical cortical
shell. Therefore the same typical, trizonal, lentelliptical shell, which in
_Larnacilla_ represents the external envelop (or cortical shell) of the
central capsule, here in _Larnacalpis_ becomes enclosed as an internal
nucleus (or medullary shell) in the interior of the central capsule, and
this latter becomes overgrown by a new lentelliptical cortical shell. The
connection between the two shells of _Larnacalpis_ is either effected by a
number of radial beams (e.g., in _Larnacalpis triaxonia_ by six beams
situated in the three dimensive axes), or by two lateral, latticed,
tube-like wings, which are repetitions of the smaller lateral wings
connecting its external shell with the internal medullary shell (as in
_Larnacalpis lentellipsis_). The latter species may be regarded as a
_Pylonium_ with a completely latticed shell.

four elliptical internal gates, connected with it by two opposite beams in
the principal axis and by two latticed wings in the transverse axis;
therefore between the two shells are four large kidney-shaped gates, halved
by the polar beams (as in _Octopyle_).

armed with symmetrically disposed radial spines. Medullary shell double,
_Larnacilla_-shaped.

The genus _Larnacantha_ has the same characteristic shell-formation as the
foregoing _Larnacalpis_, and differs from it only in the possession of

without radial spines. Medullary shell double, _Larnacilla_-shaped.

The genus _Larnacoma_ has originated from the nearly allied _Larnacalpis_
by duplication of the cortical shell. Whilst in both genera the connection
between the _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell and the primary cortical
shell is the same, many short radial beams arise from the surface of the
latter in _Larnacoma_, which at constant equal distances from it unite by a
network forming the secondary or outer cortical shell. It differs from the
similar Druppulida (_Cromyodruppa_) by the sagittal flattening of the
lentelliptical shell and the _Larnacilla_-form of the double medullary
shell.

Genus 277. _Larnacospongus_,[316] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Larnacida# with spongy lentelliptical cortical shell,
without radial spines. Medullary shell double, _Larnacilla_-shaped.

The genus _Larnacospongus_ differs from the nearly allied genera
_Larnacalpis_ and _Larnacoma_ by the spongy texture of the lentelliptical
cortical shell whilst the enclosed medullary shell in both genera is the
same trizonal _Larnacilla_-shell. Therefore _Larnacospongus_ (and the
following nearly related _Larnacostupa_) can be derived directly by
development of a spongy envelop either from _Larnacilla_ and _Larnacalpis_,
or from _Trizonium_ and _Amphipyle_.  But some species of these spongy
genera appear to be derived rather from _Tetrapyle_ or _Pylonium_, perhaps
also from _Cubotholus_.  Their phylogenetic origin may be explained in
different ways.


1. _Larnacospongus larnacillifer_, n. sp.

Cortical shell lentelliptical, one and a half times as long as broad, with
rough surface and rather loose spongy framework, directly enclosing a
trizonal _Larnacilla_-shell of the same form, but of only one-third its
size.

_Dimensions._--Length of the whole shell 0.17, breadth 0.12; length of the
medullary shell 0.06, breadth 0.04.

2. _Larnacospongus tetrapylifer_, n. sp.

Cortical shell lentelliptical, one and a third times as long as broad, with
thorny surface; composed of an outer envelop of loose spongy framework and
an inner lattice-shell with four kidney-shaped gates, like _Tetrapyle;_ the
latter encloses a trizonal medullary shell of one-fourth its size.

_Dimensions._--Length of the whole shell 0.22, breadth 0.16; length of the
medullary shell 0.045, breadth 0.035.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic, west of Tristan da Cunha, Station 332, surface.

_Definition._--#Larnacida# with spongy lentelliptical cortical shell, with
radial spines on the surface. Medullary shell double, _Larnacilla_-shaped.

The genus _Larnacostupa_ differs from the preceding Larnacospongus only in
the possession of radial spines, covering either the whole surface
irregularly or disposed in a certain symmetrical order.


1. _Larnacostupa octacantha_, n. sp.

Cortical shell lentelliptical, with thorny surface, and rather dense,
irregular, spongy framework, which arises from an inner latticed cortical
shell, like that of _Tetrapyle_ or _Pylonium_. This latter is twice as
large as the enclosed _Larnacilla_-shell. Eight long and thin, cylindrical,
radial spines, opposite in pairs in two diagonal planes. (Seems to be the
common _Tetrapyle octacantha_, enveloped by an outer spongy framework
mantle.)

_Dimensions._--Length of the whole shell (without spines) 0.22, breadth
0.16; length of the medullary shell 0.06, breadth 0.04.

_Habitat._--Indian Ocean, Madagascar, Rabbe, surface.


2. _Larnacostupa spinosa_, n. sp.

Cortical shell lentelliptical, about one and a half times as long as broad,
with very lax and irregular spongy framework, arising from a nearly
quadrangular lattice-shell like that of _Tetrapyle_; this latter encloses a
_Larnacilla_-shell of half its size. Whole surface covered with thin
bristle-like radial spines, of about the length of the shell.

_Dimensions._--Length of the whole shell (without spines) 0.18, breadth
0.12; length of the medullary shell 0.05, breadth 0.035.

_Habitat._--Antarctic Ocean, off Kerguelen, Station 150, surface.


3. _Larnacostupa dendrophora_, n. sp.

Cortical shell nearly spherical, scarcely longer than broad, with lax,
irregular spongy framework, arising from a lentelliptical trizonal
medullary shell (like _Larnacilla_). Whole surface covered with thin
arborescent radial spines, about half as long as the shell, each spine with
three to six irregular branches.

_Dimensions._--Length of the whole shell (without spines) 0.15, breadth
0.13; length of the medullary shell 0.07, breadth 0.04.

_Habitat._--Antarctic Ocean, Station 154, surface.



{628}Family XXVI. #PYLONIDA#, Haeckel, 1881 (Pl. 9).

_Pylonida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 463.

_Definition._--#Larcoidea# with regular, incompletely latticed cortical
shell, distinguished by two to four or more symmetrically disposed gates or
large fissures remaining between one to three latticed dimensive girdles
(perpendicular one to another). One, two, or three concentric systems of
such girdles (each system with three girdles) may be developed.

The family #Pylonida# is the most important and interesting among all the
#Larcoidea#, not only because it is much richer in different and peculiar
forms than the other families of this section, but also because it has
direct and very complex relations to all the other families of #Larcoidea#.
It is even possible that the Pylonida represent the original ancestral
group of the whole section, and that the apparently simpler group of the
Larcarida must be derived from the former by retrogressive metamorphosis.

Till the year 1881 the family Pylonida, which here now exhibits ten genera
with eighty-six species, was only represented by one single species,
accurately described and extensively illustrated by Johannes Müller in
1858, the well known and widely distributed cosmopolitan _Tetrapyle
octacantha_ (Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 33, Taf. iii.). A
slight modification of it was afterwards described by Ehrenberg as
_Schizomma quadrilobum_ (Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, 1872, Taf.
ii. fig. 12). A more accurate description of it, with a good explanation of
its characteristic growth, was given in 1879 by Richard Hertwig in his
Organismus der Radiolarien (pp. 52-54, Taf. iv. figs. 7, 8; Taf. vi. figs.
2, 5). In my Prodromus (1881, p. 463) I constituted for a large number of
allied species, detected in the Challenger collection, the special family
Pylonida, and distinguished among it twelve different genera. However, I
think it now better to restrict the definition of the family as given in
the above definition, and to remove from it a number of genera formerly
with it united, as the genera _Triopyle_ and _Hexapyle_, appertaining to
the #Discoidea#.

The characteristic type of all true Pylonida is clearly demonstrated by
their peculiar mode of growth, the consequence of which is the imperfect
lattice-work of the fenestrated larcoid shell. This remarkable growth is
effected by the development of elliptical latticed girdles (or rings),
which enclose a quite simple, spherical, subspherical, or lentelliptical
primordial shell. The girdles lie in three different planes, perpendicular
to one another, and are of different sizes; each girdle being somewhat
larger than the foregoing and somewhat smaller than the following girdle.
Between these latticed girdles remain on the surface of the shell large
openings or "gates," which are not closed by network, and it is just the
symmetrical disposition and form of these open "gates," separated and
enclosed by the fenestrated girdles, which give to the Pylonida their
characteristic appearance.

{629}To understand clearly this peculiar constitution of the Pylonida-shell
by a system of alternating girdles, developing one after the other it is
indispensable to pay careful attention to the three different elliptical
dimensive planes, which characterise all #Larcoidea#, and to the three
different dimensive axes, which bisect those planes. The girdle which first
develops around simple primordial shell or central chamber is the
transverse girdle, lying in the equatorial plane; then comes, secondly, the
lateral girdle, lying in the lateral plane; and thirdly follows the
sagittal girdle, lying in the sagittal or median plane. The three simplest
genera of the Pylonida--_Monozonium_, _Dizonium_, _Trizonium_--represent
these three different stages, with one, two, or three girdles. These three
genera constitute the first subfamily, Haplozonaria (with one single system
of girdles); all three girdles lie in the surface of a simple
lentelliptical cortical shell.

From this first subfamily the other two subfamilies of Pylonida must be
derived, by repetition of the same characteristic process of growth. In the
Diplozonaria a second system of girdles has been developed, constituting a
second (outer) cortical shell of lentelliptical form, concentric with the
first. Also in this second system the transverse girdle is first developed,
secondly the lateral girdle, thirdly the sagittal girdle. The three genera
_Amphipyle_, _Tetrapyle_ (with _Octopyle_), and _Pylonium_ represent these
three different stages of growth.

Commonly the growth of the Pylonida stops with the completion of the second
system but sometimes the same process is once repeated and a third system
of girdles is formed, constituting a third lentelliptical shell; in this
case also the succession of the three latticed girdles is the same; firstly
the (third) transverse girdle is formed, secondly the (third) lateral
girdle, and thirdly the (third) sagittal girdle. Each of these three
girdles of the third system encloses concentrically the corresponding
girdles of the second and first system. The three corresponding genera of
this third subfamily (Triplozonaria) are _Amphipylonium_, _Tetrapylonium_,
and _Pylozonium_. But in general this highest number of girdles (nine) is
very seldom reached; commonly the growth of the Pylonida stops with five
girdles (_Tetrapyle_ and _Octopyle_). More than nine girdles I have never
observed, though there remains the possibility of the apposition of a
fourth system owing to the peculiar imperfect character of the growth
itself.

The central or primordial chamber of the shell, with which in all Pylonida
the shell-building commences, is a quite simple, very small fenestrated
shell. Commonly one sees on the surface only five to ten small pores (three
to four on the diameter). Its form seems to be sometimes spherical,
sometimes elongated, ellipsoidal or probably lentelliptical. It may be
originally a small _Cenolarcus_. This simple central chamber, the true
"medullary shell" of the small Haplozonaria, is quite different from the
medullary shell of the larger Diplozonaria, and particularly of the
well-known _Tetrapyle_. The former observers, J. Müller as well as R.
Hertwig, have described in these forms also the medullary shell as a simple
spherical or oblong body. But a careful {630}comparison of many hundred
specimens of them and of their dimensions, has convinced me that this was
an error, and that the small spherical or elliptical medullary shell of
_Tetrapyle_ and the other Diplozonaria possesses already the same complex
structure, composed of a system of three girdles, as _Trizonium_ and
_Larnacilla_. Whilst in the Haplozonaria probably the simple central
chamber only represents the medullary shell (enclosed in the central
capsule), and the first system of girdles (complete in _Trizonium_) the
external cortical shell, with the progressive growth this latter becomes
enclosed in the central capsule and so constitutes the "trizonal medullary
shell" of the Diplozonaria and Triplozonaria.

A very difficult matter is the mode of connection between the cortical and
medullary shell. In most of the Pylonida it seems that the first or
transverse girdle (in each system) is produced by the formation of two
lateral wings or chambers (one on each side of the medullary shell), so
that each wing (or half girdle) represents a short and wide, nearly
cylindrical tube, the axis of which (with free openings on both poles) is
parallel to the principal axis of the medullary shell. In this case
(probably the ordinary one) both principal faces of the medullary shell
itself (dorsal and ventral face) constitute the middle part of the first
girdle whilst its lateral parts are formed by the wings (comparable to the
lateral chambers of _Amphitholus_).

In the second case (probably a much rarer one) there is a free ring-shaped
space between the medullary shell and the first (transverse) girdle, and
both are connected by a small number of very short and small radial beams
(R. Hertwig, _loc. cit._, p. 52, line 19 to 21 from above). This mode of
connection would be the same as is common between the concentric shells of
the #Sphæroidea# and #Prunoidea#. The distinction between these two
different modes of connection is often very difficult.

The second or lateral girdle is commonly not in direct connection with the
medullary shell, or only by some scattered radial beams (mainly in the
principal axis). This lateral guide arises by prolongation of both wings of
the transverse girdle in the lateral plane, so that from both sides (right
and left) they become united on the poles of the principal axis. The minor
axis of the elliptical lateral ring (thus formed) is therefore the major
axis of the foregoing (transverse) elliptical ring; the major axes of both
are perpendicular one to another. The major axis of the lateral ring is the
principal (or longitudinal) axis of the whole body.

The third or sagittal girdle becomes developed from the second almost in
the same manner as the second from the first. On both poles of the
principal axis two latticed wings arise from the lateral girdle, growing
further in the direction of an elliptical ring, which represents the
perimeter of the sagittal plane or median plane. These wings are already
mentioned by J. Müller as "prominent roofs, protecting the gates of the
_Tetrapyle_-shell." If these roofs grow towards the equatorial plane of the
shell and become united in pairs on the poles of the sagittal axis, the
third girdle becomes {631}complete. R. Hertwig supposes that the minor axis
of this sagittal girdle is constantly at the same time the major axis of
the lateral girdle, but this is not always the case. Very often the size of
both these girdles is nearly the same, or one is not much larger than the
other. In this case the principal axis of the body is the major axis of the
second as well as of the third girdle.

The characteristic "gates" of the Pylonida, or the large wide openings in
their cortical shell, remaining between the crossed latticed girdles, are
in general roundish, sometimes nearly circular, commonly more elliptical,
kidney-shaped or semilunar, their special form varying much according to
the different form of the girdles. The narrowest part of each girdle, or
its "isthmus," in the case of the halves of the transverse girdle is
commonly at their origin from the medullary shell, in the case of the
halves of the lateral girdle at the poles of the principal axis, and in the
case of the halves of the sagittal girdle at the poles of the sagittal
axis. The number of the gates is quite constant in the different genera. If
only one girdle (the transverse) be developed, we find only two large
gates, between the two wings on the poles of the principal axis (in
_Monozonium_, _Amphipyle_, _Amphipylonium_). In all other cases there are
four gates (determining the original name "_Tetrapyle_"), as well if only
two or if all three girdles be completed. If two girdles be complete (in
_Dizonium_, _Tetrapyle_, _Tetrapylonium_) the four gates lie opposite in
pairs on the sagittal faces (two anterior and two posterior gates), and are
limited by the transverse and lateral girdles. If all three girdles be
complete (in _Trizonium_, _Pylonium_, _Pylozonium_) the four gates lie
opposite in pairs on the lateral faces (two dorsal and two ventral gates),
and are limited by the sagittal and the transverse girdles. If we turn the
shell through an angle of 90°, we have the same aspect as in the former
group. A sagittal septum sometimes becomes developed, beginning with two
polar beams, rising from the poles of the principal axis. If these polar
beams become branched and connected with the middle part of the lateral
girdle, we get a latticed vertical septum, which divides the four gates of
_Tetrapyle_ into eight gates, _Octopyle_.

The lattice-work of the Pylonida is commonly very variable and irregular,
with roundish meshes of very unequal size, therefore without value in the
determination of the species. Commonly the outside of the shell is thorny,
and often distinguished by larger radial spines, symmetrically disposed. We
can separate these into two groups; "dimensive" spines, lying in one of the
three dimensive axes (principal, transverse, or sagittal), and "diagonal"
spines, lying crossed in pairs in diagonal axes. Among these latter eight
diagonal wing-spines, which arise from the lateral edges of the four gates,
are particularly remarkable; they are not only characteristic of _Tetrapyle
octacantha_, but also of a large number of other Pylonida, and form the
starting-point for many specific forms.

The shell of the Pylonida is characterised by extraordinary variability and
great {632}inclination to individual abnormalities, formation of varieties
and transitions into other families, hence derived, as Larnacida,
Tholonida, Lithelida, &c.

The central capsule in all Pylonida, in which I could observe it, was a
true lentellipsis (or a "triaxial ellipsoid" in the geometrical sense, with
the three unequal isopolar axes of the "rhombic octahedron"). In the living
Pylonida it is commonly coloured pink or scarlet. During growth its
dimensions are probably more or less changed, and perhaps the axes
alternate. Regarding the relation of the central capsule to the skeleton,
we can distinguish two different groups, quite as in the nearly allied
Larnacida. In the Haplozonaria (as also in the Larnacillida) the central
capsule encloses only the central chamber and is enveloped by the first
system of girdles, whereas in the Diplozonaria and Triplozonaria (as in the
Larnacalpida) that "trizonal shell" becomes enclosed (as the "medullary
shell") in the central capsule, which is now enveloped by the second system
of girdles as the "cortical shell."

Subfamily 1. HAPLOZONARIA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Pylonida# with one single system of fenestrated girdles
(with one, two, or three girdles, lying in one lentelliptical face).



{633}Genus 279. _Monozonium_,[318] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Pylonida# with simple, spherical or subspherical, central
chamber, surrounded by one single (transverse) latticed girdle.

The genus _Monozonium_ is the most simple and primitive of all Pylonida,
and may be regarded as their common ancestral form; it may probably be
derived phylogenetically either directly from _Cenosphæra_ or from
_Lentellipsis_, either by apposition of two imperfect lateral chambers, or
by surrounding it with an equatorial latticed girdle. This transverse
girdle is composed of three parts, the central chamber and two lateral
wings, which represent two short hollow latticed tubes, the axes of which
are parallel to the principal axis. On both principal sides (on the
anterior and posterior faces) there are two large open gates as in
_Amphipyle_. If we imagine the openings of the tube-shaped lateral wings
closed by lattice-work, _Monozonium_ becomes transformed into _Tholartus_,
the most simple form of Tholonida. Probably in all Pylonida the ontogeny of
the shell begins with the formation of a _Monozonium_.

Genus 280. _Dizonium_,[319] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Pylonida# with simple, spherical or subspherical, central
chamber, surrounded by two crossed latticed girdles, one smaller (primary)
transverse and one larger (secondary) lateral girdle.

The genus _Dizonium_ differs from the preceding _Monozonium_ in the
possession of two crossed elliptical lattice-girdles. The smaller girdle,
immediately surrounding the {635}central chamber, is the transverse girdle
(the single girdle of _Monozonium_). On the poles of its major axis (the
transverse axis) it is connected with the larger girdle, the elliptical
perimeter of which circumscribes the lateral plane. The minor axis of this
latter is the major axis of the former.  Between the two crossed girdles
remain four larger openings or gates, quite as in _Tetrapyle_. But whilst
in _Tetrapyle_ the enclosed medullary shell is a trizonal
_Larnacilla_-shell, here in _Dizonium_ it is a simple spherical or
lentelliptical chamber.

{637}Genus 281. _Trizonium_,[320] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Pylonida# with simple, spherical or subspherical, central
chamber, surrounded by three latticed girdles, one smaller (primary)
transverse, one larger (secondary) lateral, and one (tertiary) sagittal
girdle.

The genus _Trizonium_ represents the most highly developed form of the
Haplozonaria, with three complete elliptical latticed girdles, crossed at
right angles and lying in the perimeter of the three dimensive planes.
Commonly the first (transverse) girdle is the smallest, immediately
connected with the spherical or lentelliptical central chamber. The minor
axis of the second (lateral) girdle is identical with the major axis of the
first girdle. The third (sagittal) girdle is either larger than both
others, or intermediate between them. If the four gates between the girdles
become afterwards closed by lattice-work, the "trizonal shell" of
_Trizonium_ passes over into the typical _Larnacilla_, the ancestral form
of a great many #Larcoidea#.

Subfamily 2. DIPLOZONARIA, Haeckel.

girdles, lying in two concentric lentelliptical faces (every one system
with one to three girdles, lying in one lentelliptical face).



Genus 282. _Amphipyle_,[321] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 463.

_Definition._--#Pylonida# with trizonal lentelliptical medullary shell,
surrounded by one single (transverse) latticed cortical girdle.

The genus _Amphipyle_ opens the large series of Diplozonaria, comprising
all Pylonida, the shell of which is composed of two concentric systems of
latticed girdles; the first system constituting the characteristic
"trizonal medullary shell" or "_Larnacilla_-shell;" the second system
composed of one to three girdles of the second order. The first system lies
inside, the second outside the central capsule. In _Amphipyle_ only the
first (transverse) girdle of the second system becomes developed, and
therefore on both poles of the principal axis are two large open gates.
_Amphipyle_ repeats the two-winged form of _Monozonium_; but whilst the
medullary shell in this latter is a simple central chamber, it is here a
trizonal _Larnacilla_-shell.

Genus 283. _Tetrapyle_,[322] J. Müller, 1858, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.
Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 154.

_Definition._--#Pylonida# with trizonal lentelliptical medullary shell,
surrounded by two crossed latticed cortical girdles, one smaller (primary)
transverse, and one larger (secondary) lateral girdle. Four gates between
the two cortical girdles simple, without a sagittal septum.

The genus _Tetrapyle_, till 1881 the only known genus of the whole family,
was founded by Johannes Müller in 1858, and clearly illustrated by the
Mediterranean (and common cosmopolitan) _Tetrapyle octacantha_, hitherto
the best known type of this family. Afterwards (1860, Monatsber. d. k.
preuss. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 832) Ehrenberg founded the genus
_Schizomma_ for a nearly allied form, which exhibits only slight specific
differences (compare my Monograph, 1862, p. 434). Some good remarks on the
structure of this typical genus and its relations to other Pylonida are to
be found in Richard Hertwig's Organismus, &c., 1879, p. 52, but the true
trizonal structure of the medullary shell in this genus was not recognised
by him, so that his description agrees more with _Dizonium_. We confine
here the genus _Tetrapyle_ to those Pylonida for which _Tetrapyle
octacantha_ of J. Müller remains the determining type; the cortical shell
is composed only of two perfect lattice-girdles (the transverse and
lateral), between which four wide gates remain open. This structure is
similar to that of _Dizonium_; but whilst here the medullary shell is a
simple central chamber, in _Tetrapyle_ it is a complete trizonal or
_Larnacilla_-shell.

Cortical shell thorny, with eight long and thin, cylindrical radial spines,
lying in two crossed diagonal planes, opposite in pairs. These eight
characteristic diagonal spines (or "angular spines") are the same as in
_Amphipyle octoceros_ and many other Pylonida, and arise as prolongations
of the proximal edges of the four gates (or of the lateral wings on the
eight points, where they are intersected by the edges of the lateral ring).
This cosmopolitan, widely distributed and very variable species was a long
time the only known species of all the Pylonida, and very accurately first
described (1858) by Johannes Müller, afterwards (1879) by R. Hertwig. But
in the descriptions of these authors also some different species (such as
the following) may be confounded with the true typical _Tetrapyle
octacantha_. The four gates of this species are transverse-elliptical or
almost triangular, nearly twice as broad as high.

Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, surface.


15. _Tetrapyle cladacantha_, n. sp.

Cortical shell thorny, with eight strong ramified radial spines, lying
opposite in pairs in two crossed diagonal planes, as in the preceding
species. It differs from this by the peculiar ramification of the eight
spines, which bear two to eight simple or furcate lateral branches arising
under {649}right angles (already commencing in a transitional variety of
_Tetrapyle octacantha_, J. Müller, _loc. cit._, Taf. ii. figs. 5, 6). Four
gates transverse-elliptical, one and a half times as broad as high.

long, 0.13 broad; gates 0.05 high, 0.08 broad.

  _Tetrapyle octacantha_, var., J. Müller, 1858, Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d.

Cortical shell thorny, with eight strong radial spines, lying opposite in
pairs, as in the two foregoing species. On the distal edge each of the four
triangular gates is protected by a prominent roof of lattice-work (or
"pluteus"), which arises from the distal part of the lateral girdle and
connects the two angular diagonal spines of each gate. Therefore the shell
assumes the characteristic form very well represented by J. Müller in his
fig. 11 (seen from the lateral side) and fig. 7 (seen from the pole of the
principal axis).

{650}Genus 284. _Octopyle_,[323] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 464.

_Definition._--#Pylonida# with trizonal lentelliptical medullary shell,
surrounded by two crossed, latticed, cortical girdles; one smaller
(primary) transverse, and one larger (secondary) lateral girdle. Four gates
between the two cortical girdles divided by a sagittal septum into eight
gates.

The genus _Octopyle_ comprises those Pylonida which are distinguished from
the nearly allied _Tetrapyle_ by the development of a sagittal septum,
dividing the four gates of the latter into eight separate gates. The septum
begins with the formation of two axial rods or columellæ, which afterwards
become branched; the branches communicating one with another and with the
middle parts of the lateral girdle (on the poles of the principal axis),
there is formed a latticed septum in the sagittal plane, which separates
more or less incompletely the right and left halves of the shell. The four
gates of _Tetrapyle_ become halved by this septum, and their number
doubled.

Genus 285. _Pylonium_,[324] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 464.

_Definition._--#Pylonida# with trizonal lentelliptical medullary shell
surrounded by three crossed latticed cortical girdles, one smaller
(primary) transverse, one larger (secondary) lateral, and one (tertiary)
sagittal girdle.

The genus _Pylonium_ is the most highly developed among the Diplozonaria,
with six complete latticed girdles, three on the medullary shell, three on
the cortical shell, the latter corresponding to the former. In each of the
two systems the transverse girdle is smaller than the lateral; the sagittal
girdle may be smaller or larger than the lateral girdle. _Pylonium_ repeats
the typical form of _Trizonium_; but whilst in this latter the medullary
centre of the shell is a simple spherical chamber, here in _Pylonium_ it is
a true trizonal or _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell.

Subfamily 3. TRIPLOZONARIA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Pylonida# with three concentric systems of fenestrated
girdles, lying in three concentric lentelliptical faces (every system with
one to three girdles lying in one lentelliptical face).



Genus 286. _Amphipylonium_,[325] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 463.

_Definition._--#Pylonida# with trizonal lentelliptical medullary shell,
surrounded by a double latticed cortical shell; inner cortical shell
_Pylonium_-shaped, with three perfect crossed girdles; outer cortical shell
only represented by a single (transverse) girdle.

The genus _Amphipylonium_ opens the series of Triplozonaria, or of those
Pylonida in which the shell is composed of three concentric systems of
latticed girdles. The first (and innermost) system represents the complete
trizonal medullary shell, which is probably a lentelliptical
_Larnacilla_-shell. The first and intermediate system is formed of a
complete trizonal cortical shell of the same form, but much larger (like
_Pylonium_). The third (and outermost) system is represented by one to
three latticed girdles, corresponding to the former and forming an outer or
second cortical shell. In _Amphipylonium_ (as the most simple form of the
Triplozonaria) there is only developed the first (transverse) girdle of the
third system. It repeats therefore the form of _Amphipyle_, the cortical
shell of which is here double (Prodromus, 1881, p. 463).

Inner cortical shell lentelliptical, one and a half times as long as broad,
with smooth surface and four semilunar gates. Transverse girdle of the
outer cortical shell with two smooth semilunar wings, with convex, smooth
lateral crests; each wing as broad as the transverse girdle of the inner
cortical shell and twice as long as its lateral girdle.

_Dimensions._--Length of the lentelliptical medullary shell 0.04, breadth
0.03; length of the inner cortical shell 0.15, breadth 0.1; length of each
lateral wing of the outer cortical shell 0.3, breadth 0.1.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.

broad, with thorny surface and four kidney-shaped gates. Transverse girdle
of the outer cortical shell very spiny, with two semilunar wings, with
convex thorny lateral crests; each wing one and a half times as broad as
the transverse girdle of the inner cortical shell, and one and a half times
as long as its lateral girdle.

_Dimensions._--Length of the lentelliptical medullary shell 0.05, breadth
0.03; length of the inner cortical shell 0.16, breadth 0.12; length of each
lateral wing of the outer cortical shell 0.24, breadth 0.18.

_Habitat._--Western Tropical Pacific, Station 225, depth 4475 fathoms.


3. _Amphipylonium tetraceros_, n. sp.

Inner cortical shell hexagonal, one and a half times as long as broad, with
smooth surface and four transverse elliptical gates. Transverse girdle of
the outer cortical shell smooth, with rectilinear smooth lateral crests,
which are prolonged at both ends into strong conical spines (therefore four
spines in the lateral plane); each wing of the same breadth as the
transverse girdle of the inner cortical shell, and twice as long as its
lateral girdle.

_Dimensions._--Length of the hexagonal medullary shell 0.03, breadth 0.02;
length of the inner cortical shell 0.12, breadth 0.08; length of each
lateral wing of the outer cortical shell 0.24, breadth 0.08.

4. _Amphipylonium octoceros_, n. sp.

Inner cortical shell quadrangular, one and a third times as long as broad,
with thorny surface and four kidney-shaped gates. Transverse girdle of the
outer cortical shell thorny, constricted at the equator, with concave
thorny lateral crests, and with eight strong radial spines, opposite in
pairs and lying in two crossed diagonal planes; each wing narrower than the
transverse girdle of the inner cortical shell and twice as long as its
lateral girdle.

_Dimensions._--Length of the subspherical medullary shell 0.04, breadth
0.035; length of the inner cortical shell 0.14, breadth 0.11; length of
each lateral wing of the outer cortical shell 0.26, breadth 0.09.

Genus 267. _Tetrapylonium_,[326] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 464.

surrounded by a double latticed cortical shell; inner cortical shell
_Pylonium_-shaped, with three perfect crossed girdles; outer cortical shell
represented by two crossed girdles, one (smaller) transverse and one
(larger) lateral girdle.

{658}The genus _Tetrapylonium_ represents a further developmental stage of
the foregoing _Amphipylonium_; whilst in this latter the outer cortical
shell (or the third system of girdles) is formed only by a transverse
girdle, here this is crossed by a lateral girdle. _Tetrapylonium_ repeats
therefore the typical form of _Tetrapyle_, but with doubled cortical shell
(Prodromus, 1881, p. 464).

shell) 0.04, breadth (or transverse axis) 0.03; length of the second (or

Outer cortical shell nearly quadrangular, one and a third times as long as
broad, with four rounded corners, from which arise in the lateral plane
four three-sided pyramidal radial spines, opposite in pairs in two crossed
diagonal axes. Surface thorny; four gates elliptical or nearly

the second shell 0.1, breadth 0.07; length of the third shell 0.16, breadth
0.11.

fathoms.


4. _Tetrapylonium octacanthum_, n. sp.

Outer cortical shell elliptical, one and a third times as long as broad,
with thorny surface, and eight long and thin radial spines arising from the
corners of the four triangular gates, and lying {659}opposite in pairs in
two crossed diagonal planes. Inner cortical shell of the same shape, but
two-thirds smaller, also thorny. Transverse girdle broad, with four pores
on the isthmus. (This species appears to be the common _Tetrapyle
octacantha_, with doubled cortical shell.)

_Dimensions._--Length of the first shell 0.04, breadth 0.03; length of the
second shell 0.16, breadth 0.12; length of the third shell 0.24, breadth
0.18.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.


5. _Tetrapylonium armatum_, n. sp.

Outer cortical shell nearly quadrangular, one and a fourth times as long as
broad, with very spiny surface. Between numerous smaller (simple or
branched) thorns arise twelve larger radial spines, symmetrically
distributed, eight wing-spines crossed in two diagonal planes (as in
_Tetrapylonium octacanthum_) and four corner spines on the four rounded

Therefore this species combines the armature of both foregoing species.
Four gates kidney-shaped. Inner cortical shell elliptical, smooth,
three-fourths smaller.

Genus 288. _Pylozonium_,[327] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Pylonida# with trizonal lentelliptical medullary shell,
surrounded by double latticed cortical shell; inner cortical shell as well
as the outer _Pylonium_-shaped, each with three perfect crossed girdles
(transverse, lateral, and sagittal).

The genus _Pylozonium_ is the most highly developed form of the Pylonida,
as all three systems of concentric girdles here become fully developed,
each system with three perfect girdles. In this genus only among all the
Pylonida we find nine complete latticed girdles, and in each of the three
dimensive planes three concentric elliptical girdles. The first system
forms the medullary shell, the second system the inner cortical shell, and
the third system the outer cortical shell.

Outer cortical shell lentelliptical, thorny, one and a third times as long
as broad, without radial spines, with four kidney-shaped gates. Inner
cortical shell of the same shape, but one-third smaller, four times as
large as the lentelliptical medullary shell.

the inner cortical shell 0.16, breadth 0.12; length of the outer cortical
shell 0.24, breadth 0.18.

in two crossed diagonal planes. Inner cortical shell of the same shape but
one-fourth smaller, about twice as large as the lentelliptical medullary
shell.

_Dimensions._--Length of the medullary shell 0.065, breadth 0.045; length
of the inner cortical shell 0.18, breadth 0.12; length of the outer
cortical shell 0.24, breadth 0.18.

Family XXVII. #THOLONIDA#, n. fam. (Pl. 10).

_Definition._--#Larcoidea# with regular, completely latticed cortical
shell, which is composed of two to six or more hemispherical or cap-shaped
domes (vaulted chambers or cupolas). The domes lie opposite in pairs on the
poles of the three dimensive axes, are separated by annular constrictions,
and surround a simple or _Larnacilla_-shaped central chamber.

The family #Tholonida# represents a peculiar and very remarkable group of
the #Larcoidea#, distinguished from the other groups of this suborder by
the characteristic form of the shell, composed of a variable number of
hemispherical domes or cupolas. The middle and original part of the shell
is constantly formed of an elliptical or subspherical central chamber,
which often, but not constantly, contains a small medullary shell. An even
number (two, four, six, or more) of domes is attached to the poles of the
three dimensive axes of the central chamber; according as only one, or two,
or all three axes develop cupolas, we distinguish in this family three
different subfamilies (the Amphitholida, Staurotholida, and Cubotholida).
The Amphitholida (or Tholonida monaxonia) form cupolas only on the two
poles of one single axis, and this axis corresponds to the minor (or
transverse) axis of the central chamber, we find here therefore constantly
at least two lateral cupolas (Pl. 10, figs. 1-7). The Staurotholida (or
Tholonida diaxonia) form cupolas on the poles of two axes perpendicular one
to another; these two axes are the major (principal) and the minor
(transverse) axis of the central chamber, we find here therefore constantly
at least four cupolas crossed in pairs (Pl. 10, figs. 8-11).  The
Cubotholida (or Tholonida triaxonia) form cupolas on the poles of all three
dimensive axes (perpendicular one to another); corresponding to the
principal, transverse, and sagittal axes of the lentelliptical central
chamber; therefore we find here constantly at least six cupolas, attached
in pairs on the six sides of the central chamber (Pl. 10, figs. 12-17).

The number of genera and species in the family #Tholonida# is rather large,
but the number of individuals is much smaller than in most of the other
SPUMELLARIA, and {661}particularly than in the nearly allied Pylonida; the
greater number of the species are very rare. Besides this they seem to be
very variable and inclined to produce numerous abnormalities. Very often
intermediate forms of transition are to be found between the Tholonida and
other #Larcoidea#, particularly the Pylonida and Lithelida. In many species
the thick-walled shell is very opaque, and offers great difficulties to the
clear study; in the greater number the structure of the shell cannot be
understood completely without rolling the shell to the different sides; and
the distinction between the Staurotholida and Cubotholida is often very
difficult.

The primordial chamber of the Tholonida, or the central chamber in which
its growth begins, is either a simple lentelliptical shell (without
enclosed medullary shell), like _Cenolarcus_, or it is a trizonal shell,
like _Larnacilla_, and contains a small concentric medullary shell. But
this important inner shell of the central chamber offers peculiar
difficulties for study. In many cases (probably in the greater number)
there is no doubt the same characteristic trizonal medullary shell, which
we found in the Larnacida and Pylonida, and this is our principal argument,
if we regard the Tholonida as #Larcoidea#, which are most nearly allied to
both these families, and in which the fenestrated open cortical girdles of
the Pylonida are replaced by fenestrated closed cupolas or domes; the
characteristic "gates" or large fissures in the cortical shell of the
former are therefore here perfectly closed by network. The Tholonida agree
in this point with the Larnacida, but are distinguished from them by the
prominent vaultings of the hemispherical cupolas or domes, which give them
a peculiar appearance. Each pair of domes (opposite on both poles of one
dimensive axis) corresponds to one single girdle of the Pylonida.

Regarding the absence or presence of a medullary shell in the central
chamber, we may divide the Tholonida into two groups, Cenotholida (without
medullary shell) and Coccotholida (with medullary shell). The absence of
the medullary shell in many Tholonida may be either primary (original) or
secondary (by reduction and loss of it). Probably in the larger proportion
(if not always?) its absence is the consequence of reduction and loss, and
in this case the Cenotholida must be derived phylogenetically from the
Coccotholida, but possibly often (or always?) the contrary may also be the
case. At present we cannot find certain arguments for one opinion or the
other.

The connection between the medullary (internal) and the cortical (external)
shell of the central chamber in the Coccotholida is effected by two lateral
wings of a latticed transverse girdle; on both sides of the latter remain
the four internal open "gates" of the Pylonida and Larnacida. Very often
the limiting edges of these four gates are prolonged into eight external
radial spines which lie opposite in pairs in two crossed diagonal planes,
and correspond to the eight portal-spines of _Tetrapyle octacantha_.
Besides these, we often find four other beams opposite in pairs in the two
crossed axes (principal and lateral).  Very often also these radial beams
(between medullary and {662}cortical shells) are prolonged on the outside
into prominent free radial spines. But other spines may also arise from the
surface. Very remarkable is the presence of twenty symmetrically disposed
radial spines in some forms of Amphitholida (_Amphitholus acanthometra_ and
_Amphitholonium acanthonium_, &c.). It recalls the twenty radial spines of
the #Acanthonida#, though the laws of distribution in the two similar cases
are quite different.

The cortical shell of the Tholonida remains either simple, or it becomes
doubled by formation of an outer veil or envelope. This outer cortical
shell or "veil" may either repeat completely the typical form of the inner
with its cupolas, or it may form an ellipsoidal envelope without
dome-shaped partitions. Its network is either like that of the inner, or it
is very delicate and irregular, spider-web like. The connection between the
two cortical shells is effected by a variable number of radial beams, often
prolonged on the outside into radial spines.

The growth of the Tholonida by apposition of new chambers is very
characteristic, constantly pairs of chambers originating at both opposite
poles of the three dimensive axes, firstly on the transverse axis, secondly
on the principal axis, thirdly on the sagittal axis. It is possible that by
repeated apposition of new chambers the Tholonida are transformed into
#Discoidea#, but commonly the number of domes is restricted, two in the
Amphitholida, four in the Staurotholida, six in the Coccotholida. If new
chambers in an irregular manner or in a spiral order be opposed to those
first formed pairs of chambers, the Tholonida may be transformed into
Soreumida, Streblemida, or Lithelida. The phylogenetic connection between
these families is probably very complex and very worthy of further
research.

The network of the shell in the Tholonida is sometimes regular, with
circular (often hexagonally framed) pores of equal size, sometimes
irregular, with roundish pores of unequal size. Commonly the shell is thick
and compact; in those genera in which the cortical shell is doubled, the
inner is commonly compact, the outer a very delicate veil.

The central capsule of the Tholonida is originally always enclosed by the
central chamber, and like this of lentelliptical form, a triaxial
ellipsoid. With the apposition of cupolas the growing central capsule may
form dome-shaped protuberances which enter into the former. So we may find
in the Amphitholida a central capsule with three joints (separated by two
annular parallel constrictions), in the Staurotholida a cross-shaped
capsule (with four caps around the central lentellipsis), in the
Cubotholida a clustered capsule with six caps, surrounding six sides of the
cubical central mass. In the Coccotholida (with medullary shell in the
central chamber) the latter encloses in the centre the nucleus of the cell.
The calymma, or the jelly-veil between the central capsule and the
enveloping shell, probably always exhibits annular constrictions,
corresponding to those which separate the cupolas of the shell. All these
anatomical peculiarities in the Tholonida require a further accurate study.

Subfamily 1. AMPHITHOLIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Tholonida# with monaxial growth; cupolas opposite on the

Genus 289. _Tholartus_,[328] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Tholonida# with simple cortical shell (without external
veil); with two hemispherical cupolas, opposite on the poles of one axis;
central chamber between them simple (without medullary shell).

{664}The genus _Tholartus_ (Pl. 10, fig. 1) represents the most simple form
of all Tholonida, a three-jointed simple cortical shell without medullary
shell; two hemispherical cupolas or domes are attached on both lateral
sides of a simple triaxial ellipsoidal central chamber, corresponding to
the poles of its lateral or transverse axis. _Tholartus_ may be regarded as
the common ancestral form of all Tholonida, and may be derived either from
the Pylonida _Monozonium_ (by complete lattice-locking of the lateral
wings) or from the Ellipsida _Cenellipsis_ (by development of two lateral
protuberances on the poles of the transverse axis). But it is also possible
that the absence of the medullary shell is produced by reduction, and in
this case _Tholartus_ may be descended from _Amphitholus_.

Central chamber one and a half times as high and as broad as both cupolas.
Surface of the shell rough. Pores regular, circular, without hexagonal

Genus 290. _Tholodes_,[329] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Tholonida# with double cortical shell (with external veil),
with two hemispherical cupolas, opposite on the poles of one axis; central
chamber between them simple (without medullary shell).

The genus _Tholodes_ (Pl. 10, fig. 2) differs from _Tholartus_, its
probable ancestral form, only in the duplication of the shell; the outer
shell has exactly the same three-jointed form as the inner; both are
connected by eight radial beams, lying in two diagonal planes and
corresponding to the eight frontal spines of _Tetrapyle octacantha_.
Possibly _Tholodes_ may also be descended from _Amphitholonium_ by loss of
the medullary shell. I have observed only one single specimen of this
genus.


1. _Tholodes cupula_, n. sp. (Pl. 10, fig. 2).

Outer shell of the same form and structure as the inner shell. Central
chamber larger than both cupolas. Surface a little rough, without radial
spines. Distance of both shells equals the height of the outer cupolas.
Pores of both shells regular, circular, three times as broad as the
{666}bars; six to seven in the semicircle of one inner cupola, ten to
twelve in the semicircle of one outer cupola. Both shells are connected by
eight radial beams, crossed in two diagonal planes.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the outer shell 0.1, minor 0.065; major axis
of the inner shell 0.05, minor 0.04; pores 0.006, bars 0.002.

_Habitat._--Western Tropical Pacific, Station 225, depth 4475 fathoms.



Genus 291. _Amphitholus_,[330] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Tholonida# with simple cortical shell (without external
veil), with two hemispherical cupolas, opposite on the poles of one axis;
central chamber (between them) _Larnacilla_-shaped, with medullary shell.

The genus _Amphitholus_ is the most simple form of all Coccotholida (or all
Tholonida provided with medullary shell). Its simple cortical shell
exhibits, like _Tholartus_, two lateral hemispheric cupolas, attached on
both sides of a lentelliptical central chamber (on the poles of its
transverse axis). The central chamber has the form of a triaxial ellipsoid,
and contains, like _Larnacilla_, a small medullary shell, connected with it
by the wings of a latticed transverse girdle. _Amphitholus_ may be derived
either from _Tholartus_ by secondary production of a cortical shell, or
(more probably) from _Larnacilla_ by apposition of two lateral dome-shaped
protuberances. In the latter case it may be regarded as an _Amphipyle_, the
lateral open wings of which are closed by lattice-work.

shell rough. Pores regular, circular, with prominent hexagonal frames,
twice as broad as the bars; eight to ten in the basal semicircle of one

bars 0.004.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 272, depth 2600 fathoms.


2. _Amphitholus artidium_, n. sp.

Central chamber one-fourth higher than both cupolas. Surface of the
cortical shell smooth. Pores irregular, roundish, once to three times as

_Definition._--Surface of the shell with radial spines or thorns.


3. _Amphitholus octacanthus_, n. sp.

Central chamber about twice as high and broad as both cupolas. From the
surface arise, symmetrically distributed, eight stout conical radial
spines, lying in two diagonal planes, as prolongations of the eight
wing-beams, which connect the _Tetrapyle_-shaped medullary shell with the
two ring-like constrictions of the cortical shell. Pores of the latter
regular, circular, twice as broad as the bars; ten to twelve in the basal
semicircle of one cupola.

Central chamber a little larger than both cupolas. From the surface arise
twelve strong conical radial spines, four on the poles of the major and the
minor axis of the shell, lying in the lateral plane; eight others lying in
two diagonal planes, as prolongations of the eight wing-beams, which
connect the _Tetrapyle_-shaped medullary shell with the two ring-like
constrictions of the cortical shell. Pores of the latter irregular,
roundish, twice to four times as broad as the bars; sixteen to eighteen in
the basal semicircle of one cupola.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the shell 0.15, minor 0.11; pores 0.004 to
0.008, bars 0.002.

Central chamber about twice as broad and as high as both cupolas. On the
surface quite symmetrically distributed twenty long and strong cylindrical
radial spines; eight in the sagittal plane or in the meridian plane of the
central chamber (four opposite in pairs in the principal and the sagittal
axes, four others in the middle between the principal and the sagittal
spines); four in the horizontal transverse plane, on both sides of the
poles of the major or lateral axis; and eight in diagonal planes
(corresponding to the eight wing-spines of _Tetrapyle octacantha_). In the
centre of the central chamber is a distinct trizonal medullary shell like
that of _Tetrapyle_, with two vertical columella beams. Pores of the
cortical shell subregular, circular, with elevated hexagonal frames, about
four times as broad as the bars; five to seven in the semicircle of one
cupola. (This remarkable species differs from _Tholartus vicenus_ in the
possession of a medullary shell, from _Amphitholonium acanthometra_ by the
simple cortical shell. Compare these species).

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the shell 0.14 to 0.16, minor axis 0.10 to
0.12; pores 0.015, bars 0.004; major axis of the medullary shell 0.04 to
0.05, minor (horizontal) axis 0.02 to 0.03; length of the twenty radial
spines 0.18 to 0.24, basal breadth 0.01.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 300, depth 1375 fathoms.


{668}6. _Amphitholus armatus_, n. sp.

Central chamber twice as broad, but of the same height, as the flat vaulted
cupolas. Surface armed with thirty to forty very large three-sided
prismatic spines, longer than the major axis of the shell. Pores irregular,

Central chamber of the same breadth and height as both cupolas. Surface
armed with very numerous (sixty to eighty) strong conical spines, about as
long as the minor axis of the shell. Pores subregular, circular, twice as
broad as the bars; sixteen to eighteen in the basal semicircle of one
cupola.

8. _Amphitholus panicium_, n. sp. (Pl. 10, fig. 4).

Central chamber ellipsoidal, nearly twice as broad, but of the same height,
as both cupolas. Whole surface thorny; the largest radial thorns about as
long as the medullary shell. Pores irregular, roundish, twice to four times
as broad as the bars. On the base of each cupola a circle of ten to twelve
larger square pores, separated by radial beams, which are prolonged into
stouter free spines. This remarkable formation of the cupolas, very rare in
this family, recalls the characteristic formation of the distal chambers of
the Panartida and Zygartida (_e.g._, Pl. 40, figs. 4, 8, &c.), where it is
very common.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the shell 0.15, minor 0.1; pores 0.005 to
0.012, bars 0.003; large square pores 0.02; axes of the medullary shell

Genus 292. _Amphitholonium_,[331] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Tholonida# with double cortical shell (with external veil),
with two hemispherical cupolas, opposite on the poles of one axis; central
chamber (between them) _Larnacilla_-shaped, with medullary shell.

The genus _Amphitholonium_ differs from the nearly allied _Amphitholus_
(probably its ancestral form) only in the duplication of the cortical
shell; the outer has the {669}same three-jointed form as the inner, and is
connected with it by a variable number of radial beams. From the similar
_Tholodes_ it differs in the possession of a medullary shell.


1. _Amphitholonium tricolonium_, n. sp. (Pl. 10, fig. 7).

Outer cortical shell smooth, of the same three-jointed form as the inner,
at an equal distance from it throughout the whole circumference; central
chamber higher-vaulted than both cupolas. Network of the outer shell
delicate, with subregular, circular pores. Pores of the thick-walled inner
shell subregular, circular, with hexagonal frames, three times as broad as
the bars; eight to ten in the basal semicircle of one cupola.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the outer cortical shell 0.2, minor axis 0.15;
major axis of the inner cortical shell 0.16, minor axis 0.11; pores 0.01,
bars 0.0035.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 302, depth 1450 fathoms.


2. _Amphitholonium octostylium_, n. sp.

Outer cortical shell lentelliptical, smooth, not articulated, at a varying
distance from the three-jointed inner shell; central chamber of the latter
twice as high as both hemispherical cupolas. Network of the outer shell
very thin, cob-web like. Pores of the inner shell subregular, roundish,
twice as broad as the bars; six to seven in the semicircle of one cupola.
Eight thin and long, bristle-shaped, radial spines, opposite in pairs in
two crossed diagonal planes.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the outer cortical shell 0.16, minor 0.12;
major axis of the inner cortical shell 0.12, minor 0.09; pores 0.01, bars
0.005.

3. _Amphitholonium acanthonium_, n. sp.

Outer cortical shell of the same three-jointed form as the inner, at a
uniform distance from it; central chamber higher vaulted than both cupolas.
Network of the outer shell irregular, delicate, of the inner regular,
strong, with circular, hexagonally framed pores, three times as broad as
the bars; eight to nine in the semicircle of one cupola. On the surface,
quite symmetrically disposed, twenty long and strong, cylindrical, radial
spines; eight in the sagittal plane, four in the transverse plane; eight in
two diagonal planes between the former and the latter. The remarkable
geometric disposition of the twenty spines is in this species quite the
same as in _Amphitholus acanthometra_. It differs from this nearly allied
species in the double cortical shell.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the outer cortical shell 0.18, minor 0.14;
major axis of the inner cortical shell 0.14, minor 0.1; pores 0.012, bars

{670}Subfamily 2. STAUROTHOLIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Tholonida# with diaxial growth; cupolas crossed in pairs,
opposite on the poles of two axes, perpendicular one to another. (Shell
commonly five-chambered, with four domes, cross-wise surrounding the
central chamber.)



Genus 293. _Tholostaurus_,[332] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Tholonida# with simple cortical shell (without external
veil), composed of four hemispherical cupolas in cross-form, opposite in
pairs on the poles of two axes perpendicular one to another; central
chamber simple (without medullary shell).

The genus _Tholostaurus_ is the most simple form of the Staurotholida, or
the Tholonida with four crossed hemispherical cupolas, lying on the poles
of two axes perpendicular one to another. The central chamber communicates
by four wide openings with the four domes, and contains no medullary shell.
_Tholostaurus_ may originate either from _Tholartus_ by apposition of two
opposite cupolas between the first pair, or from _Staurotholus_ by loss of
the medullary shell.



Subgenus 1. _Tholostaurantha_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Surface of the shell smooth or rough, without radial spines.


1. _Tholostaurus quadrigatus_, n. sp.

All four cupolas nearly of the same size and form, subregular. Surface
smooth, without radial spines. Pores subregular, circular, four times as

as the bars; twelve to fourteen in the basal semicircle of one cupola.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the shell 0.16, minor axis 0.12; pores 0.006,
bars 0.003.

regular, circular, hexagonally framed, twice as broad as the bars; twelve
to fourteen in the semicircle of one cupola. Four long and stout conical
radial spines, two vertical on the poles of the principal axis, two
horizontal on the poles of the transverse axis.

0.003.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 288, surface.


4. _Tholostaurus octobelonis_, n. sp.

Two opposite cupolas larger than the two others. Pores subregular,
circular, three times as broad as the bars; ten to twelve in the semicircle
of one cupola. Eight long and thin, needle-shaped, radial spines, in pairs
crossed in two diagonal planes.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 291, surface.


5. _Tholostaurus dodecabelos_, n. sp.

Two opposite cupolas larger than the two others. Pores irregular, roundish,
twice to three times as broad as the bars; six to eight in the semicircle
of one cupola. Twelve thin and long radial spines, four on the poles of the
two crossed axes (principal and lateral), eight crossed in two diagonal
planes.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the shell 0.14, minor 0.11; pores 0.006 to
0.01, bars 0.003.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 244, depth 2900 fathoms.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the shell 0.15, minor axis 0.12; pores and
bars 0.007.

_Habitat._--Indian Ocean, Zanzibar, Pullen, depth 2200 fathoms.



Genus 294. _Tholoma_,[333] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Tholonida# with double cortical shell (with external veil),
composed of four hemispherical cupolas in cross-form, opposite in pairs on
the poles of two axes perpendicular one to another; central chamber simple
(without medullary shell).

{672}The genus _Tholoma_ (Pl. 10, figs. 10, 13) differs from the preceding
_Tholostaurus_ (its probable ancestral form) only in the duplication of the
shell. The outer (secondary) shell has the same cross-form as the inner
(primary) shell. In the two observed species the growth seems to be
different, in the first species all four cupolas of each cross being of the
same size, form, and age; in the second two opposite cupolas, larger and
apparently older than the other two. _Tholoma_ is possibly the offspring of
_Staurotholonium_, from which it may have been produced by loss of the
medullary shell.



Subgenus 1. _Tholomantha_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Surface of the shell smooth, without radial spines.


1. _Tholoma quadrigeminum_, n. sp. (Pl. 10, fig. 10).

All four chambers in each cortical shell nearly equal, subregular. Surface
smooth, without radial spines. Structure of the network in both shells
similar. Pores regular, circular, twice as broad as the bars; six to eight
in the basal semicircle of one inner, ten to twelve in the semicircle of
one outer cupola.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the outer shell 0.14, of the inner 0.09; pores
0.006, bars 0.003.

_Definition._--Surface of the shell with radial spines.


2. _Tholoma metallasson_,[334] n. sp. (Pl. 10, fig. 13).

Two opposite chambers in each cortical shell larger than the two others;
the larger chambers of the inner shell corresponding to the smaller
chambers of the outer shell. Network in both shells of the same structure,
regular, with circular, hexagonally framed pores of the same breadth as the
bars; eight to ten in the semicircle of an inner, fourteen to sixteen in
the semicircle of an outer cupola. Numerous (twenty to thirty or more)
thin, cylindrical, bristle-shaped, long radial spines, symmetrically
disposed.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the outer shell 0.26, minor axis 0.2; major
axis of the inner shell 0.16, minor axis 0.13; pores and bars 0.006.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 265, depth 2900 fathoms.



Genus 295. _Staurotholus_,[335] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Tholonida# with simple cortical shell (without external
veil), composed of four hemispherical cupolas in cross-form, opposite in
pairs on the poles of {673}two axes perpendicular one to another; central
chamber _Larnacilla_-shaped (with enclosed medullary shell).

The genus _Staurotholus_ differs from _Tholostaurus_ in the possession of a
medullary shell in the central chamber, and may be derived from this genus
by its production. But it may also be derived from _Amphitholus_ by
apposition of two secondary opposite cupolas between the two primary
cupolas. The symmetrical position of an increasing number of radial spines
in the different species is remarkable (resembling _Tholostaurus_ as well
as _Amphitholus_).

_Definition._--Surface of the shell smooth or rough, without radial spines.


1. _Staurotholus quadratus_, n. sp.

Surface of the cortical shell rough. The two principal cupolas somewhat
larger than the two lateral cupolas; therefore the longitudinal axis longer
than the transverse. Pores irregular, roundish, twice to three times as

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the shell 0.16, minor 0.13; pores 0.005 to
0.009, bars 0.003.

semicircle of one cupola. Medullary shell elliptical. On the surface four
long cylindrical radial spines; two in the principal and two in the lateral

The two principal cupolas twice as broad and high as the two lateral
cupolas. Pores subregular, circular, four times as broad as the bars; six
to eight in the semicircle of one cupola. Ten long and thin radial spines
with thickened conical bases, about as long as the major axis of the shell,
by inner prolongations connected with the lentelliptical medullary shell;
two polar spines in the principal axis, eight wing-spines in two crossed

subregular, circular, three times as broad as the bars; five to seven in
the semicircle of one cupola. Twelve strong cylindrical radial spines, four
on the poles of the two larger axes (two principal and two lateral), eight
wing-spines in two crossed diagonal planes. Medullary shell hexagonal.

Genus 296. _Staurotholonium_,[336] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Tholonida# with double cortical shell (with external veil),
composed of four hemispherical cupolas in cross-form, opposite in pairs on
the poles of two axes perpendicular one to another; central chamber
_Larnacilla_-shaped (with medullary shell).

{675}The genus _Staurotholonium_ differs from the nearly allied
_Staurotholus_ (its probable ancestral form) only in the duplication of the
cortical shell. The outer shell commonly repeats the cross-form of the
inner, with four corresponding cupolas; but sometimes the four cupolas of
the outer shell alternate in size and form with those of the inner, or the
outer shell forms a simple lenticular envelope around the inner. From the
similar _Tholoma_, _Staurotholonium_ differs in the possession of a
medullary shell in the central chamber.

_Definition._--#Tholonida# with triaxial growth; cupolas lying in pairs on
the six sides of a cubical central chamber, opposite at the poles of three
axes perpendicular one to another. (Shell commonly seven-chambered, with
six domes surrounding the central chamber.)



Genus 297. _Tholocubus_,[337] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Tholonida# with simple cortical shell (without external
veil), composed of six hemispherical cupolas, opposite in pairs on the
poles of three axes perpendicular one to another, covering six sides of the
simple cuboidal central chamber (without medullary shell).

The genus _Tholocubus_ is the most simple form of the Cubotholida, or of
the Tholonida with domes situated in three axes perpendicular one to
another; six hemispherical cupolas lying on the six sides of a cuboidal
central chamber; this latter contains no medullary shell. _Tholocubus_ may
be derived phylogenetically either from _Tholostaurus_ by apposition of two
opposite domes on the flat sides of the cross-shell, or from _Cubotholus_
by loss of the medullary shell.



Subgenus 1. _Tholocubulus_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Surface of the shell smooth or rough, without radial spines.


1. _Tholocubus tessellatus_, n. sp. (Pl. 10, fig. 12).

Surface of the shell smooth, without radial spines. Pores regular,
circular, hexagonally framed, twice as broad as the bars; eight to twelve
pores on the semicircle of one cupola. Principal cupolas smaller than the
lateral, larger than the sagittal cupolas.

roundish, once to three times as broad as the bars; twelve to sixteen pores
in the semicircle of one cupola. All six cupolas nearly of the same size.

composed of six hemispherical cupolas, opposite in pairs on the poles of
three axes perpendicular one to another, covering six sides of the simple

The genus _Tholonium_ (Pl. 10, fig. 17) differs from the preceding

(secondary) shell forms either a simple (spheroidal or ellipsoidal) thin
veil around the inner (primary) shell, or both shells are of the same form,
with six corresponding cupolas. Possibly _Tholonium_ is the offspring of
_Cubotholonium_, having originated by loss of the medullary shell.

_Habitat._--Indian Ocean, Zanzibar, Pullen, depth 2200 fathoms.



Subgenus 2. _Tholonilla_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Surface of the outer shell covered with radial spines or
thorns.

Outer shell ellipsoidal, without dome-shaped protuberances, covered with
numerous (thirty to fifty) thin and long, bristle-shaped radial spines;
network very delicate, irregular, with roundish pores. Inner shell with six
marked hemispherical domes of somewhat different sizes; pores regular,
circular, with prominent hexagonal frames, twice as broad as the bars; ten
to twelve on the basal semicircle of one cupola.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the outer shell 0.15, minor axis 0.14; major
axis of the inner shell 0.13, minor axis 0.12; pores 0.008, bars 0.004.

Genus 299. _Cubotholus_,[339] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Tholonida# with simple cortical shell (without external
veil), composed of six hemispherical cupolas, opposite in pairs on the
poles of three axes perpendicular one to another, covering six sides of the
cuboidal _Larnacilla_-shaped central chamber (with medullary shell).

The genus _Cubotholus_ differs from _Tholocubus_ in the possession of a
medullary shell in the central chamber, and may be derived from this genus
by its production; but it may also be derived from _Staurotholus_ by
apposition of two opposite domes on the flat sides of the cross-shell.
Sometimes all six domes are of the same size and form, but commonly
different in pairs.



Subgenus 1. _Cubotholissa_, Haeckel.

of the same size and form. Surface smooth. Pores regular, circular, twice
as broad as the bars; eight in the basal semicircle of each cupola.
Medullary shell apparently spherical (?), connected with the eight corners
of the central chamber by eight radial beams, regularly disposed. (This
species is remarkable for the perfect symmetry of the shell, the six sides
of which appear to be quite similar. It differs from the similar
_Tholocubus regularis_ in the possession of a medullary shell.)

2. _Cubotholus quadraticus_, n. sp.

Surface of the shell smooth. Both principal cupolas (on the poles of the
longitudinal axis) larger than the four other cupolas, which have the same
size and lie cross-wise in the equatorial plane. (Therefore two of the
three fundamental axes equal, the third larger.) Pores subregular,
circular, three times as broad as the bars; ten to twelve in the semicircle
of each cupola-basis.

_Dimensions._--Major axis 0.16, minor axis 0.12; pores 0.012, bars 0.004.

_Habitat._--Indian Ocean, Zanzibar, Pullen; depth 2200 fathoms.


{681}3. _Cubotholus rhombicus_, n. sp.

Surface of the shell smooth. Both principal cupolas (on the poles of the
longitudinal axis) larger than the two lateral (on the poles of the
transverse axis), and these larger than the two sagittal cupolas (on the
poles of the sagittal axis). Therefore all three fundamental axes unequal.
Pores irregular, roundish, twice to four times as broad as the bars; eight
to twelve in the basal semicircle of each cupola. Medullary shell
lentelliptical.

_Dimensions._--Major (principal) axis 0.16, middle (lateral) axis 0.14,
minor (sagittal) axis 0.12; pores 0.006 to 0.012, bars 0.003.

_Definition._--Surface of the shell with radial spines or thorns.


4. _Cubotholus octoceras_, n. sp.

All six cupolas in pairs of different sizes. Both principal domes larger
than the lateral domes, and these larger than the sagittal domes. Pores
subregular, circular, twice as broad as the bars; eight to ten in the
semicircle of each cupola. From the surface arise (at the intersecting
points of every three cupolas) eight strong conical radial spines, about as
long as the shell-axis; they lie in two diagonal planes, and are the
external free prolongations of eight inner beams (homologous with the eight
wing-spines of _Tetrapyle octacantha_), which connect the lentelliptical
medullary shell with the eight corners of the cuboidal central chamber.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the cortical shell 0.15, middle 0.13, minor
0.11; pores 0.008, bars 0.004; diameters of the medullary shell
corresponding to 0.05, 0.04, 0.03.

_Habitat._--Western Tropical Pacific, Station 224, depth 1850 fathoms.



Genus 300. _Cubotholonium_,[340] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Tholonida# with double (or sometimes triple) cortical shell
(with external veil), composed of six hemispherical cupolas, opposite in
pairs on the poles of three axes perpendicular one to another, covering six
sides of the cuboidal _Larnacilla_-shaped central chamber (with medullary
shell).

The genus _Cubotholonium_ differs from the nearly allied _Cubotholus_ (its
probable ancestral form) only in duplication of the cortical shell. I have
observed only two species of this rare form, both rather different. In the
first species the outer cortical shell forms a simple spherical thin veil
around the inner, the six cupolas of which are nearly of the same form and
size. In the second species each of the domes of the {682}inner cortical
shell is protected by an outer larger cupola, and besides this the whole
shell is enveloped by a thin ellipsoidal veil (Pl. 10, fig. 15). Therefore
this species may be the representative of a peculiar genus, the most highly
developed of all Tholonida--_Tholothauma_.


1. _Cubotholonium sphæroides_, n. sp.

Outer cortical shell (or veil) spherical, with smooth surface; network very
delicate, with very thin bars and very small irregular, roundish pores.
Inner cortical shell simple, composed of six hemispherical cupolas,
surrounding the six sides of the cubical central chamber, which encloses a
spherical medullary shell (one-third as large as itself). Network of the
inner cortical shell regular, with circular pores of the same breadth as
the bars, twelve to fourteen in the basal semicircle of one cupola.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spherical outer shell 0.2, of the inner
cortical shell 0.15; pores and bars of the latter 0.006.

_Habitat._--Indian Ocean, Zanzibar, Pullen, depth 2200 fathoms.


2. _Cubotholonium ellipsoides_, n. sp. (Pl. 10, fig. 15).

  _Tholothauma ellipsoides_, Haeckel, 1883, MS.

opposite pairs somewhat larger than the alternating pairs. Pores
subregular, circular, about the same breadth as the bars; eight to twelve
in the basal semicircle of one cupola. Central chamber with ellipsoidal
medullary shell. Radial spines short, very numerous.

major axis of the inner cortical shell 0.16, minor axis 0.14; pores and
bars 0.006; medullary shell 0.03.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.



Family XXVIII. #ZONARIDA#, n. fam. (Pl. 50, figs. 9-12).

_Definition._--#Larcoidea# with regular, completely latticed cortical
shell, distinguished by two to four or more annular constrictions, which
lie (all or partly) in the dimensive planes (sagittal, transverse, or
lateral), and by which four to eight or more vaulted cupolas or dome-like
chambers become separated. In the centre of this chambered cortical shell
lies constantly a trizonal or _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell.

The family #Zonarida# comprises a small number of peculiar #Larcoidea#,
resembling the Tholonida in the composition of the polythalamous cortical
shell by a number of cupolas or dome-shaped protuberances. But the
disposition and origin of these latter {683}are quite different. Whilst in
the Tholonida the axes of the domes are dimensive axes, and these are
separated by annular constrictions lying in diagonal planes, in the
Zonarida we find the contrary; the axes of the domes are here diagonal
axes, and these are separated by annular constrictions lying in dimensive
planes. However, this definition agrees absolutely only in the
four-chambered _Zonarium_ and in the eight-chambered _Zonidium_, whilst in
the six chambered _Zoniscus_ only four domes are disposed according to this
law, two others, however, in the same manner as in the Tholonida. Therefore
this genus is intermediate between both families.

_The Cortical Shell_ of the Zonarida is in all cases completely latticed
and of regular lentelliptical fundamental form, as in the nearly allied
Larnacida and Tholonida. The three dimensive axes are constantly of
different sizes, each with two equal poles; commonly (as in the human body)
the principal or longitudinal axis is the longest, the sagittal (or
dorso-ventral) axis the shortest; the transverse (or lateral) axis being
intermediate between them. Of the three dimensive planes the lateral plane
is the largest (determined by the principal and transverse axes); the
smallest is the equatorial plane (crossed by the transverse and sagittal
axes); the sagittal plane (determined by the sagittal and principal axes)
being intermediate between them.

The annular constrictions of the cortical shell which produce the
dome-shaped protuberances are different in number in the three known
genera--two, three, or four. To each constriction often (but not always)
corresponds an internal latticed septum, which connects the cortical with
the medullary shell. The number of the cupolas is always double the number
of the annular constrictions by which they are separated, therefore four,
six, or eight.

In all known Zonarida the sagittal septum is quite constant, but derived
from the original axial rod, which lies in the principal axis. By
ramification of this axial beam and reticular connection with the sagittal
girdle arises the sagittal septum, which we found first in _Octopyle_,
halving the four gates of _Tetrapyle_. Whilst this sagittal septum (between
right and left halves of the body) is common to all three known genera of
this family, the number and shape of the other annular constrictions are
different. In _Zonarium_ (Pl. 50, fig. 9) we find only one transverse
constriction (in the equatorial plane), in _Zoniscus_ (figs. 10, 11) two
parallel transverse constrictions (parallel to the equatorial plane, on
both sides of it). _Zonidium_ (fig. 12) is a combination of both foregoing
genera; it has three parallel transverse constrictions (one in the
equatorial plane, and one on each side of it).

_The Latticed Domes_ (cupolas or chambers) of the cortical shell exhibit
correspondingly a different number and disposition in the three known
genera. In _Zonarium_ are found only four crossed chambers, separated by
the sagittal and transverse septa; the axes of the four crossed domes are
diagonal axes, whilst in the similar _Staurotholus_ they are dimensive axes
(principal and transverse axes). In _Zonidium_ we find eight domes, each
cupola of _Zonarium_ being halved by a diagonal septum. _Zoniscus_ is
intermediate {684}between the two foregoing genera, and has six cupolas,
three on each side of the sagittal septum.

The inner communication of the cupolas or chambers is more or less free,
the lattice-work of the separating septa between them commonly remaining
more or less imperfect, or represented only by some isolated beams or
meshes. The outer network of the cupolas is commonly irregular (as in the
majority of #Larcoidea#), but sometimes distinguished by a small number of
regularly disposed larger apertures (similar to the "gates" of the
Pylonida). From the surface radial spines often arise in characteristic
number and symmetrical disposition, commonly as prolongations of the septal
axes or of the constricted edges.

The _Medullary Shell_ in all Zonarida is a true trizonal or
_Larnacilla_-shaped lattice-shell (compare above, p. 600); its perimeter
(or the first lateral girdle) is sometimes more elliptical, at other times
more hexagonal; the hexagon is amphithect; both its lateral sides are often
concave and commonly longer than the four other sides.

The _Central Capsule_ in all Zonarida is in a strict geometrical sense a
true lentellipsis (compare above, p. 599); its principal axis is commonly
one and a third to one and a half times as great as the transverse axis,
and twice to three times as great as the sagittal axis. The lentelliptical
central capsule encloses the trizonal medullary shell, whilst it is
externally enveloped by the chambered cortical shell.

The genus _Zonarium_ is the most simple form of the Zonarida, and differs
from the nearly allied _Larnacalpis_ by two ring-like constrictions, which
are crossed at right angles, one in the sagittal (or median) plane, and one
in the transverse (or equatorial) plane. By these two annular constrictions
four egg-shaped or kidney-shaped chambers become imperfectly separated,
which correspond to the quadrants of the lateral plane. The first cause of
the marked constrictions may be the formation of the latticed sagittal
septum, which is found first in _Octopyle_, as halving the four gates of
{685}_Tetrapyle_. Between this septum and the constricted narrow transverse
girdle the cortical shell grows out in the form of four vaulted cupolas;
every two opposite domes are congruent, two neighbouring are symmetrically
equal.

Genus 302. _Zoniscus_,[342] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Zonarida# with six dome-shaped chambers of the cortical
shell, separated by three annular constrictions (one sagittal and two
transverse, parallel to the equatorial plane).

The genus _Zoniscus_ differs from _Zonarium_ as well as from _Zonidium_ by
the development of the transverse girdle, which is not constricted, but on
the contrary prominently vaulted in the equatorial plane. Therefore both
wings of the transverse girdle form here two opposite lateral or
"equatorial cupolas," as in _Amphitholus_. These are separated from four
other domes (the "corner cupolas") by two transverse annular constrictions,
which correspond to the free edges of the original transverse girdle. The
corner domes of each pair are separated from each other by the sagittal
septum.

half times as long as broad. Surface thorny, without larger radial spines.
Sagittal constriction scarcely half as long as the hexagonal medullary
shell. Both equatorial cupolas (or wings of the transverse girdle) scarcely
half as large as the four corner cupolas.

_Dimensions._--Length of the cortical shell 0.15, breadth 0.11; length of
the medullary shell 0.07, breadth 0.045.

times as long as the lentelliptical medullary shell. Both equatorial
cupolas about as large as the four corner cupolas.

_Dimensions._--Length of the cortical shell 0.12, breadth 0.09; length of
the medullary shell 0.035, breadth 0.025.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 244, depth 2900 fathoms.


{687}3. _Zoniscus tetracanthus_, n. sp. (Pl. 50, fig. 10).

Cortical shell nearly quadrangular, one and a half times as long as broad,
with four prominent corners, from which arise in the lateral plane four
strong, three-sided pyramidal radial spines (opposite in pairs in two
crossed diagonal axes). Surface thorny, with exception of the concave
lateral sides. Sagittal constriction two and a half times as long as the
hexagonal medullary shell. Both equatorial cupolas scarcely half as large
as the four corner cupolas.

_Dimensions._--Length of the cortical shell 0.18, breadth 0.12; length of
the medullary shell 0.07, breadth 0.04.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 271, depth 2425 fathoms.


4. _Zoniscus octacanthus_, n. sp.

as broad, with spiny surface. Eight longer thin radial spines opposite in
pairs in two crossed diagonal planes (as in _Tetrapyle octacantha_).
Sagittal constriction two and a half times as long as the hexagonal
medullary shell. Both equatorial cupolas somewhat larger than the four
corner cupolas.

_Dimensions._--Length of the cortical shell 0.16, breadth 0.12; length of
the medullary shell 0.055, breadth 0.04.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 263, depth 2650 fathoms.


5. _Zoniscus hexatholius_, n. sp. (Pl. 50, fig. 11).

Cortical shell nearly rectangular, with four rounded corners and deep
sagittal constriction, one and a fourth times as long as broad with thorny
surface. Twelve longer edged radial spines; eight opposite in pairs in two
crossed diagonal planes (as in the foregoing species), four others in the
lateral plane, opposite in pairs on both sides of the sagittal
constriction, which is scarcely twice as long as the hexagonal, in the
equatorial plane constricted medullary shell. Both equatorial cupolas
nearly of the same size as the four corner cupolas.

_Dimensions._--Length of the cortical shell 0.16, breadth 0.13; length of
the medullary shell 0.07, breadth 0.04.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 300, depth 1375 fathoms.



Genus 303. _Zonidium_,[343] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Zonarida# with eight dome-shaped chambers of the cortical
shell, separated by four annular constrictions (one sagittal, one
transverse, and two others parallel to the latter).

The genus _Zonidium_ must be regarded as a _Zonarium_, in which the four
cupolas (in the quadrants of the lateral plane) are halved by diagonal
beams or latticed septa, {688}lying opposite in pairs in two crossed
diagonal planes. Therefore the number of the septa (four) and the domes
(eight) is here doubled. Among the eight cupolas we distinguish four median
(on both sides of the sagittal plane) and four lateral (on both sides of
the equatorial plane); both groups are of different size and form. Probably
_Zonidium_ is derived from _Zonarium_ by lattice-connection between the
eight diagonal wing-spines, which in both species of this genus are
present, the same as in _Tetrapyle octacantha_.


1. _Zonidium octostylium_, n. sp.

Cortical shell nearly quadrangular, with rounded corners and thorny
surface. Eight long and thin radial spines on both sides of the lateral
plane opposite in pairs and lying in two crossed diagonal planes (as in
_Tetrapyle octacantha_). Sagittal constriction three times as long as the
lentelliptical medullary shell. Four medial cupolas (on both sides of the
sagittal plane) somewhat larger than the four lateral cupolas (on both
sides of the equatorial plane).

_Dimensions._--Length of the cortical shell 0.15, breadth 0.12; length of
the medullary shell 0.05, breadth 0.03.

_Habitat._--Indian Ocean, Madagascar, Rabbe, surface.


2. _Zonidium octotholium_, n. sp. (Pl. 50, fig. 12).

Cortical shell nearly octangular, with spiny surface; twenty long and stout
radial spines between numerous smaller spines; eight wing-spines opposite
in pairs in two crossed diagonal planes (as in the preceding species);
twelve other strong spines in the lateral plane (four longer opposite in
pairs on the poles of the principal and transverse axes, eight others
smaller, alternating between these and the diagonal spines). Sagittal
constriction twice as long as the hexagonal medullary shell. Four median
cupolas somewhat smaller than the four lateral cupolas.

_Dimensions._--Length of the cortical shell 0.18, breadth 0.15; length of
the medullary shell 0.07, breadth 0.05.

_Habitat._--Indian Ocean, Zanzibar, Pullen, depth 2200 fathoms.



Family XXIX. #LITHELIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 49, figs. 1-7).

_Lithelida_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 515.

_Definition._--#Larcoidea# with symmetrical spiral shell, divided by the
spiral plane into two symmetrical halves; all windings of the spiral lie in
this plane. Primordial chamber either simple or _Larnacilla_-shaped.

The family #Lithelida# comprises all those #Larcoidea# in which the growth
of the latticed shell is spirally winding in one plane, _Nautilus_-like.
They agree in the spiral growth with the following family. But in the
Streblonida the spiral is screw-shaped, {689}ascending (like _Helix_).
Therefore in these latter the geometrical fundamental form of the shell is
asymmetrical or "dysdipleural," whereas in the Lithelida
bilateral-symmetrical or "eudipleural." The lentelliptical or nearly
spherical shell may be divided by a median section into two symmetrical
halves; the right half is the mirror image of the left half.

When in 1862 I founded the family Lithelida in my Monograph (p. 515), I
knew only one genus, _Lithelius_, with two species. The rich material of
the Challenger collection contains a great number of similar spirally
constructed #Larcoidea#, so that at the present time we may distinguish at
least six genera. These belong to two different subfamilies, which may
possibly be afterwards better separated as families. The first subfamily,
Spiremida, possess a simple, spherical or subspherical, medullary shell;
the second subfamily, Larcospirida, possess a trizonal or
_Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell. No doubt these latter must be derived
from Pylonida, as we observe all stages of development starting from a
simple _Trizonium_; but perhaps also the Spiremida have the same origin,
their simple, spherical or subspherical, medullary shell being derived from
a trizonal or _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell by reduction.

The general appearance in both subfamilies of the Lithelida is quite the
same, and it requires a careful study of the medullary shell to distinguish
certainly the Spiremida from the Larcospirida. This distinction is often
not easy, particularly in the larger forms; the shell is often very opaque
and difficult to understand. Only in one position, if the spiral axis be
parallel to the axis of the eye of the observer, and the spiral plane be
therefore fully seen in the optical plane of the microscope, the spiral
line (or the axial section of the latticed spiral lamella) is distinctly
observed; in all other positions the figure of the spiral is more or less
indistinct, and the whole microscopical image often quite intricate and
confused. The sufficient study of this family requires therefore the
contemplation of the shell from different sides, and is the more difficult,
as the variability of the Lithelida--as of the Pylonida--is extraordinarily
great.

The description which I gave of _Lithelius_ (1862) in my Monograph is in
some points erroneous, and was afterwards (1879) corrected by R. Hertwig,
who explained particularly the near relation of it to _Tetrapyle_. Indeed
the intermediate forms between the Lithelida and the Pylonida are so
numerous and so evident in all stages of development, that the derivation
of the former (at least of the Larcospirida) from the latter is quite
clear. The analogy between the structure of the Lithelida and the
calcareous (foraminiferous) Alveolinida is not so complete as I supposed it
to be in my Monograph (1862); particularly the formation of the small
chambers between the turnings of the spiral lamella is much more complete
in the Alveolinida than in the Lithelida.

The cortical shell of all Lithelida has the same geometrical fundamental
form as _Nautilus_ or as the nautiloid Polythalamia (_Polystomella_,
_Nummulites_, &c.); therefore the shell is dipleural, being divided by the
median plane into two symmetrical lateral halves. {690}Since the spiral
line lies in the median plane, we will call it the spiral plane; it
separates the right half from the left. The axis of the body, around which
the spiral turns (without touching it), is the spiral axis. The latticed
part of the cortical shell, which turns around them, is the spiral lamella.
Only in one genus of our family, viz., _Tholospira_, are the spiral axis,
the lateral axis, the spiral plane, and the sagittal plane quite as in
_Nautilus_. In all other genera this disposition is different or is
uncertain. This depends on the different part of the cortical shell, from
which the spiral growth begins. In this respect we can distinguish four
different modes.

In the Larcospirida (or the Lithelida with _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary
shell) the spiral growth exhibits four quite different forms. It begins
here with _Larcospira_, in which already the first cortical girdle of the
Diplozonaria determines the spiral growth; one wing of this girdle, the
transverse girdle of _Amphipyle_, grows more swiftly than the other,
overgrows it, and thus turns around the principal axis. In _Pylospira_ the
first or transverse girdle is already perfectly formed (as in _Amphipyle_),
and the spiral growth is introduced by the second or lateral girdle of
_Tetrapyle_; one wing of it (the right or the left) grows more swiftly than
the other, overgrows it, and thus turns around the sagittal axis. In
_Tholospira_ also the second girdle is complete, and the spiral growth
begins from the third or sagittal girdle. One of its wings grows more
swiftly than the other, overgrows it, and thus turns around the transverse
axis. Consequently we see that each of the three dimensive planes of the
lentelliptical Larcoid-body may be the spiral plane: in _Larcospira_ the
transverse plane, in _Pylospira_ the lateral plane, in _Tholospira_ the
sagittal plane. Correspondingly the spiral axis in the first genus is the
principal, in the second the sagittal, in the third the transverse axis of
the central _Larnacilla_-shell. Therefore in these three genera the spiral
plane is the plane of the latticed girdle, which determines the spiral
growth, one of both its wings overgrowing the other.

In each of the three above mentioned genera the spiral may be simple or
double; it remains simple if only one of both wings of the turning girdle
overgrow the other, and this latter remain a simple half girdle (or
tube-like wing). Whereas the spiral becomes double if the second wing of
the girdle afterwards follow the example of the first wing and now turn
around it in the same direction. As this happens in all three genera, we
can subdivide them into six subgenera.

A quite peculiar form of spiral growth is produced in _Spironium_, in which
the direction of growth in both lateral wings of the transverse girdle is
inverse from the beginning. The left wing grows against the posterior, the
right wing against the anterior pole of the principal axis, turning around
it in crossed, eight-like spirals. The whole shell afterwards assumes a
lentelliptical form.

Commonly between the embracing spiral turnings or convolutions a great
number of radial beams is developed, irregularly disposed and often
branching; they support the {691}thin spiral lamellæ and give to the whole
shell more solidity. Often these beams form imperfect radial septa, by
which the spiral cavity of the turnings is divided into a variable number
of chambers. But these chambers never become so regular and perfect as in
the analogous nautiloid Polythalamia.

In many Lithelida the growth of the shell reaches a certain limit,
concluding with the formation of a superficial latticed lamella of
lentelliptical or nearly spherical form. In many other forms of the family
this seems not to be the case; but these may possibly be younger forms,
afterwards reaching the same limit.

The network of the shell in the Lithelida is commonly quite irregular, and
so variable that its special conformation has usually no value in the
determination of the species. The surface of the shell is often covered
with radial spines, which are sometimes arborescent.

The central capsule seems always to preserve the same lentelliptical form
(or triaxial ellipsoid) as in all other #Larcoidea#. With the increase of
growth it encloses successively a larger part of the spiral cortical shell,
but on the outside is constantly protected by the last turnings of the
spiral, or by the lattice-lamella of the surface.

_Definition._--#Lithelida# with simple, spherical or subspherical,
medullary shell, and lentelliptical or subspherical, spirally constructed
cortical shell; surface smooth or thorny, without radial spines.

{692}The genus _Spirema_ begins the series of the Spiremida, or of those
Lithelida in which the medullary shell presents a simple latticed sphere or
ellipsoid, never composed of a double, trizonal or _Larnacilla_-shaped
shell. In the present state of our knowledge we cannot say whether this
simple medullary shell be a primary formation, or effected by secondary
means, by reduction of a double _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell, which
is constantly found in the Larcospirida. The species of this genus (as of
all Lithelida) are difficult to distinguish, are transformistic, and
incline very much to variations and abnormalities. The spiral may be simple
or double.

_Definition._--#Lithelida# with double, trizonal, or _Larnacilla_-shaped
medullary shell.



Genus 306. _Larcospira_,[346] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Lithelida# with double, trizonal, or _Larnacilla_-shaped
medullary shell; cortical shell subspherical or lentelliptical, constructed
of a simple or double spiral of the transverse girdle (or primary cortical
girdle); the spiral lamella revolving around the principal axis.

The genus _Larcospira_ begins the interesting series of the Larcospirida,
or of those Lithelida in which the medullary shell is formed by a trizonal
or _Larnacilla_-shaped lattice-shell, and the cortical shell by spiral
turnings of one of the three girdles, which compose the cortical shell of
the Pylonida. In _Larcospira_, as the oldest and most simple form of
Larcospirida, the spiral is formed by the transverse girdle, or the first
girdle of the Diplozonaria, the only cortical girdle of _Amphipyle_. If in
this genus one of both wings of the transverse girdle grow stronger than
the other and overgrow the latter, turning {696}around the principal axis,
we reach the characteristic form of _Larcospirema_, the first subgenus of
_Larcospira_; but if afterwards the second wing follow the example of the
first, and overgrow it from the other side, we reach the typical form of
the second subgenus, _Larcospironium_. In this latter subgenus the spiral
becomes double, whilst in the former it remains simple.

Cortical shell with smooth surface, four times as long as the
lentelliptical medullary shell. Perimeter of the lateral plane elliptical,
one and a half times as long as broad, without constrictions. One lateral
wing of the transverse girdle is more strongly developed and turns around
the other in two to three simple spiral turns.

constriction at the poles of the principal axis. One lateral wing of the
transverse girdle turns around the other in one and a half to two simple
spiral turns.

the transverse girdle turn round one another and form one and a half to two
double spiral turns.

the medullary shell 0.04, breadth 0.035.

Genus 307. _Pylospira_,[347] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Lithelida# with double, trizonal or _Larnacilla_-shaped
medullary shell; cortical shell subspherical or lentelliptical, constructed
of a single or double spiral of the lateral girdle (or second cortical
girdle); the spiral lamella revolving round the sagittal axis.

The genus _Pylospira_ follows after _Larcospira_ as the second genus of
Larcospirida; but in this latter the spiral of the cortical shell is formed
by the transverse girdle (or the first lattice-girdle of the Diplozonaria),
whilst in _Pylospira_ it is produced by the lateral girdle, or the second
lattice-girdle of that group. Therefore _Pylospira_ may be derived
phylogenetically from _Tetrapyle_ in the same manner as _Larcospira_ from
_Amphipyle_. Whilst in this latter the first cause of the spiral turning,
the unequal growth of both girdle-wings, proceeds from the transverse
girdle, in _Pylospira_ it proceeds from the lateral girdle. One of its
wings overgrows the other, turning around the sagittal axis. If the second
wing do not become developed, the spiral remains simple and represents the
subgenus _Pylospirema_; but if afterwards the second wing follow the
example of the first and overgrow it from the other side, we reach the
typical form of the second subgenus, _Pylospironium_, with a double spiral.

or nearly hexagonal, with four rounded corners (on the poles of two crossed
diagonal axes), one and a third times as long as broad. Eight internal
egg-shaped gates (as in _Octopyle_), between the complete lateral wings of
the transverse girdle, and two axial beams in the principal axis. One
single wing of the lateral girdle turns around the other in two to three
simple spiral turns.

3. _Pylospira cymbium_, n. sp.

Cortical shell with smooth surface, seven times as long as the
lentelliptical medullary shell. Perimeter of the lateral plane elliptical,
one and a third times as long as broad. Four internal kidney-shaped gates
between the complete lateral wings of the transverse girdle (as in
_Tetrapyle_). Both principal wings of the lateral girdle turn round one
another in two to two and a half double spiral turns.

_Dimensions._--Length of the cortical shell 0.22, breadth 0.17; length of
the medullary shell 0.03, breadth 0.025.

{699}Genus 308. _Tholospira_,[348] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Lithelida# with double, trizonal or _Larnacilla_-shaped
medullary shell; cortical shell subspherical or lentelliptical constructed
of a simple or double spiral of the sagittal girdle (or third cortical
girdle); the spiral lamella revolving around the transverse axis.

The genus _Tholospira_ represents the third genus of Larcospirida. Whilst
the spiral growth of the cortical shell is produced in _Larcospira_ by the
first (transverse) girdle of the Diplozonaria, in _Pylospira_ by the second
(lateral) girdle, in _Tholospira_ it is effected by the third or sagittal
girdle, which we found complete in _Pylonium_. If in this genus one wing of
the sagittal girdle overgrow the other remaining one and turn around the
transverse axis, we get _Tholospirema_, the first subgenus of our genus,
with simple spiral; but if afterwards the second wing follow the example of
the first, and overgrow it from the other side, we get _Tholospironium_,
with double spiral.

{701}Genus 309. _Spironium_,[349] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Lithelida# with double, trizonal or _Larnacilla_-shaped
medullary shell; cortical shell subspherical or lentelliptical, constructed
of two crossed spirals, which arise from both lateral wings of one girdle
(commonly the lateral girdle) and revolve in an opposite diagonal direction
around the principal axis.

The genus _Spironium_ differs in a very remarkable manner from all
foregoing Lithelida, and is distinguished by a quite peculiar mode of
growth. It is most nearly allied to _Larcopyle_, and may, like this, be
derived from _Amphipyle_ (or rather from _Larnacilla_, beginning to
transform into _Amphipyle_). But whilst in _Larcopyle_ one of the two wings
of the lateral girdle overgrows the other in the direction of the
transverse axis (turning around the principal axis), here in _Spironium_
both lateral wings begin at the same time to grow out from the lateral
sides of the _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell; the most remarkable thing
is, however, that the direction of growth in the wings is diverse from the
beginning: the left wing grows downwards and turns around the lower
(aboral) pole of the principal axis, the right wing grows upwards and turns
around the upper (oral) pole of the same axis. Thus both wings of the
lateral girdle are crossed in diagonal axes, and with increasing growth one
overgrows the other in the direction of these diagonals, so as to resemble
the figure 8 in shape. The open gates remaining between the turnings of the
girdle become afterwards closed on the surface by irregular lattice-work,
and so the whole cortical shell assumes finally a spherical, ellipsoidal,
or lentelliptical form. Its surface sometimes becomes covered with simple
or branched radial spines. In the interior the eight characteristic
egg-shaped gates of _Octopyle_ are commonly (or constantly?) visible, two
strong radial beams in the principal axis arising from the poles of the
lentelliptical medullary shell.

branched (similar to _Cromyodrymus abietinus_, Pl. 30, fig. 6). The spiral
wings of the transverse girdle only half as broad as the eight internal
gates between them and the strong beams of the principal axis.

Family XXX. #STREBLONIDA#, n. fam. (Pl. 49, figs. 8, 9).

_Definition._--#Larcoidea# with asymmetrical, spiral, polythalamous shell,
composed of a variable number of roundish chambers, which form together an
ascending spiral; both halves of the shell unequal. Primordial chamber
either simple or _Larnacilla_-shaped.

The family #Streblonida# comprises those #Larcoidea# in which a number of
chambers is arranged in an ascending spiral, round a simple or trizonal
primordial chamber, like winding stairs. They show the same spiral
structure as in the foregoing {703}family, but whilst in the Lithelida the
spiral line lies in one plane (as in _Nautilus_), in the Streblonida it
ascends like a screw (as in _Helix_). Therefore the former have the same
relation, regarding the spiral structure, to the nautiloid Polythalamia as
the latter to the turbinoid Foraminifera. Indeed the single forms of
Streblemida repeat in their special structure the characteristic genera of
Turbinoida, such as _Globigerina_, _Rosalina_, _Pulvinulina_,
_Hastigerina_, &c. As in these calcareous turbinoid Foraminifera, so also
in the analogous siliceous Streblonida the distinction of species is very
difficult and open to many objections.

The number of species in this family is very small; all are rare and for
the most part very opaque and difficult to understand, so that the
following distinction of a dozen species can have only a provisional value.
To get a complete idea of their peculiar structure, the shell must be
turned and observed from different sides, and thus their full study
requires yet much time and work. There are to be found evident transitional
forms between them and the Lithelida on the one hand and the Soreumida on
the other. Besides this, most species of Streblonida seem to have more
inclination to individual varieties and abnormalities than the majority of
the other Radiolaria.

The general form of the whole shell is in the Streblonida sometimes more
egg-shaped or even subspherical, at other times more top-like or conical,
sometimes nearly discoidal. The height of the shell (or the vertical axis
of the ascending spiral) is occasionally larger, at other times smaller
than the breadth (or the greatest horizontal diameter, perpendicular to the
height). Some very flat forms seem to approach the Lithelida. With regard
to the internal screw-formation, the shell of all Streblonida is
asymmetrical.

The number of the aggregated incomplete chambers is commonly between ten
and twenty, but ascends sometimes to thirty, forty, or more. Sometimes the
size of all the chambers is nearly the same, sometimes they increase
gradually, occasionally also very rapidly. The primordial chamber (or the
first and oldest) seems to be commonly the smallest, and inversely, the
last and youngest chamber, the largest. But sometimes (in _Streblopyle_)
also the contrary may be the case. The form of the single chambers is very
variable, from the spherical or hemispherical through all transitions
leading to irregular roundish or longish forms. The network is commonly
irregular, with small roundish pores of different sizes, but sometimes also
regular, circular. The surface of the shell is commonly smooth or rough,
rarely covered with radial spines. In most species the reticulation and
particularly the  separation of the chambers is more or less incomplete.

As in the Lithelida, so also in the Streblonida we can distinguish two
subfamilies. In the Streblacanthida (_Streblonia_, _Streblacantha_) the
primordial chamber is a simple, spherical, subspherical, or lentelliptical
latticed shell. In the Streblopylida (_Streblopyle_) the primordial chamber
is trizonal or _Larnacilla_-shaped, as in the greater number of
#Larcoidea#, composed of three elliptical latticed girdles of unequal size,
perpendicular one to another, and surrounding a simple central chamber. As
in the Lithelida, so also {704}here we cannot certainly say whether the
former have originated from the latter by reduction of the
_Larnacilla_-shell, or whether both groups be of different origin. The
latter is perhaps more probable. This family as well as the foregoing
requires a much more careful study than I could give to it.

Genus 310. _Streblonia_,[350] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Streblonida# with simple, spherical, subspherical, or
lentelliptical primordial chamber, beginning the screw-like series of
spirally ascending chambers. Surface smooth or thorny, without radial
spines.

The genus _Streblonia_ contains those Streblonida in which a variable
number of roundish, subspherical, or longish chambers form a screw-like
aggregate, beginning with a quite simple primordial chamber. The special
order of the complex spiral offers interesting resemblances to different
genera of the calcareous Foraminifera, from which I have taken the
corresponding name of the species. The whole form of the shell is sometimes
more egg-shaped or subspherical, at other times more top-like or conical,
occasionally very flat.  Its surface is smooth or rough, but not covered
with radial spines.

same breadth as the bars; about sixteen on the breadth of the tenth

Shell top-shaped or flatly conical, with twelve to sixteen chambers of
gradually increasing size, the tenth chamber about four times as broad as
the first. Breadth of the shell twice as large as the height. Pores

Genus 311. _Streblacantha_,[351] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Streblonida# with simple, spherical, subspherical, or
lentelliptical primordial chamber, beginning the screw-like series of
spirally ascending chambers. Surface covered with radial spines.

The genus _Streblacantha_ differs from the nearly allied _Streblonia_ only
in the covering of radial spines, and bears therefore the same relation to
it as _Hastigerina_ has to _Globigerina_ amongst the similar calcareous
Polythalamia.

  _Streblonia siderolina_, Haeckel, 1883, MS.

Shell flatly conical, with fourteen to sixteen nearly hemispherical
chambers of gradually increasing size, the tenth chamber about six times as
broad as the first. Breadth of the shell nearly equal to the height. Pores
subregular, circular, hexagonally framed, twice as broad as the bars; about
nine pores on the breadth of the tenth chamber. Surface covered with
numerous short conical radial spines, one-fourth to one-sixth as long as
the diameter of the shell.

Shell nearly spherical, clustered, with nine to eleven nearly spherical
chambers of rapidly increasing size, the tenth chamber about six times as
broad as the first. Breadth of the shell nearly equal to the height. Pores
subregular, circular, of about the same breadth as the bars. Surface
bristly, covered with numerous very thin and long, needle-shaped radial
spines, longer than the diameter of the shell. (Resembles closely
_Hastigerina_.)

_Dimensions._--Breadth of the shell 0.18, height 0.15.

Genus 312. _Streblopyle_,[352] n. gen.

_Definition_.--#Streblonida# with trizonal lentelliptical medullary shell
(composed like _Larnacilla_ of three elliptical dimensive girdles
surrounding one simple central primordial chamber). From this begins a
screw-like series of spirally ascending chambers. Surface smooth or thorny,
without radial spines.

The genus _Streblopyle_ presents externally the same appearance and contour
as _Streblonia_, and is composed like this of a variable number of
chambers, ascending screw-like around the axis of the spiral shell. The
first or primordial chamber, however, in which the growth begins, is in
_Streblonia_ a simple spherical shell, but in _Streblopyle_ a trizonal
shell or _Larnacilla_-shell (compare above, p. 600). The chambers are very
incompletely separated, and comparatively much larger, their number much
smaller than in _Streblonia_. The structure in the species of this genus is
difficult to understand.


1. _Streblopyle helicina_, n. sp. (Pl. 49, fig. 9).

Shell helicoid, one and a third times as high as broad, with eight to
twelve incomplete semizonal chambers, ascending spirally from the lateral
half girdle of the lentelliptical medullary shell, octopyle-shaped, and
enveloping it in three to four spiral turnings. The height of the whole
cortical shell equals nearly five times the height of the trizonal
medullary shell. Pores irregular, roundish. Surface of the shell rough or
nearly smooth. (This species seems to be nearly allied to _Spironium
octonium_.)

_Dimensions._--Breadth of the spiral cortical shell 0.18, height 0.24;
breadth of the medullary shell 0.04, height 0.05.

2. _Streblopyle spirulina_, n. sp.

Shell egg-shaped or nearly spherical, about as high as broad, with eight to
nine semizonal chambers, ascending spirally from the subspherical trizonal
medullary shell, and enveloping it in {708}four to five turnings. The sixth
chamber twice as broad as the trizonal medullary shell. Pores irregular,
roundish.  Surface of the shell thorny.

_Dimensions._--Breadth of the spiral cortical shell 0.27, height 0.25;
breadth of the medullary shell 0.05, height 0.06.

Family XXXI. #PHORTICIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 49, figs. 10, 11).

_Phorticida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 464.

_Definition._--#Larcoidea# with quite irregular monothalamous shell,
representing irregular modifications of an original lentelliptical latticed
shell; the irregular cortical shell encloses a regular or subregular,
lentelliptical or trizonal medullary shell.

The family Phorticida comprises a small number of #Larcoidea# in which a
subregular, trizonal, lentelliptical medullary shell is enclosed by an
irregular simple or spongy cortical shell. The lattice-work of the latter
is sometimes simple and complete, at other times incomplete, with open
gates (as in the Pylonida), sometimes also spongy. Its form is always more
or less irregular, roundish, often dimply or tuberous; different from most
other #Larcoidea#.

The medullary shell is constantly a regular or subregular
_Larnacilla_-shell, composed of three elliptical latticed girdles of
different sizes, perpendicular one to another. This leaves no doubt that
the Phorticida are true #Larcoidea#. The connection of it with the cortical
shell is rarely effected by radial beams, commonly by two opposite latticed
wings, which are identical with the lateral halves of the transverse girdle
in the Pylonida diplozonaria (_Amphipyle_, _Tetrapyle_). Often also between
this transverse and a second (lateral) girdle there remain large open
gates, so that the affinity between these Phorticida and the Pylonida
cannot be doubted. In other cases these gates become closed, so that they
more nearly approach the Larnacida. From both families they differ by the
irregularity of the papillate or tuberous cortical shell. The network is
more or less irregular, its surface often thorny, but never covered with
symmetrically disposed radial spines.

The central capsule is lentelliptical, encloses the medullary shell, and is
enveloped by the cortical shell, as in the nearly allied Pylonida and
Larnacida, of which the Phorticida may be regarded as irregular aberrant
forms.

{709}Genus 313. _Phorticium_,[353] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 464.

_Definition._--#Phorticida# with irregular cortical shell of simple
lattice-work, enclosing a lentelliptical _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary
shell.

The genus _Phorticium_ comprises all Phorticida in which the irregular
cortical shell is formed by simple lattice-work, not by spongy framework.
We can divide this genus into two subgenera: in _Phortopyle_ (as in the
_Pylonida_) the lattice-work of the cortical shell exhibits large openings
or gates; in _Phortolarcus_ these gates are perfectly closed by network;
the former may be regarded as abnormal or irregular Pylonida, the latter as
modifications of Larnacida.



Subgenus 1. _Phortopyle_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Lattice-work of the irregular cortical shell incomplete,
with large openings or gates.

Cortical shell irregular, roundish, about three times as large as the
enclosed lentelliptical, regular, _Larnacilla_-shell, connected with it by
some radial beams and irregularly latticed girdles; between these remain
four to eight large open gates of irregular roundish form and size; and
these gates are the same as in _Tetrapyle_ and _Octopyle_. This very
variable species may be regarded as a monstrosity of those genera of
Pylonida; it is very common, but all individuals are more or less unequal;
some specimens approach to some common species of _Tetrapyle_. The surface
of the shell is more or less spiny.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the irregular cortical shell 0.12 to 0.18;
length of the lentelliptical medullary shell 0.05 to 0.06, breadth 0.035 to
0.045.

_Habitat._--Cosmopolitan; Mediterranean, Atlantic, Pacific, &c., common,
surface and in various depths.


2. _Phorticium spironium_, n. sp.

Cortical shell irregular, roundish, tuberous, about four times as large as
the enclosed subregular _Larnacilla_-shell, connected with it by some
irregular radial beams, and by opposite, spirally begining, irregularly
latticed girdles, comparable to those of _Spironium_; between them remain
six to twelve large open gates of irregular size and form. Surface rough.
The resemblance to some forms of _Spironium_ makes it probable that this
species is a deformity or monstrosity of that genus.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the irregular cortical shell 0.12 to 0.2, of the
lentelliptical medullary shell 0.03 to 0.06.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Stations 270 to 274, surface, and in
various depths.



{710}Subgenus 2. _Phortolarcus_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Lattice-work of the irregular cortical shell complete,
without large openings or gates.


3. _Phorticium deforme_, n. sp.

Cortical shell irregular, roundish or longish, three times as large as the
enclosed subregular, lentelliptical _Larnacilla_-shell, connected with it
by two opposite latticed wings (the halves of the transverse girdle of
_Tetrapyle_). Network of the cortical shell irregular, dense, perfectly
closed, without larger openings or gates. Surface thorny. (May be regarded
as a monstrous form of _Larnacalpis_.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the irregular cortical shell 0.15 to 0.18, of
the medullary shell 0.04 to 0.06.

_Habitat._--Pacific, central area, Station 272, depth 2600 fathoms.


4. _Phorticium abnorme_, n. sp.

Cortical shell irregular, roundish, tuberous, with five to ten quite
irregular or nearly hemispherical protuberances, which resemble the cupolas
of Zonarida. The regular lentelliptical _Larnacilla_-shell is one-third to
one-fourth as large as the enclosing cortical shell, and is connected with
it by some irregular radial beams. Lattice-work completely closed, without
gates. Surface spiny. (May be regarded as an anomalous form of _Zonidium_;
as in the other species of this variable genus, the individuals are very
unequal.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the irregular cortical shell 0.12 to 0.2, of the
medullary shell 0.03 to 0.05.

_Habitat._--Atlantic and Pacific, tropical zone, surface, and at various
depths.



Genus 314. _Spongophortis_,[354] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 464.

_Definition._--#Phorticida# with irregular cortical shell of spongy
framework, enclosing a lentelliptical _Larnacilla_-shaped medullary shell.

The genus _Spongophortis_ differs from _Phorticium_ in the spongy framework
of the cortical shell. This encloses the inner _Larnacilla_-shaped
medullary shell either directly, or both shells are separated by a hollow
interval, and connected either by radial beams or by latticed lamellæ.
Perhaps both these subgenera might be better separated as genera.

lentelliptical medullary shell, without hollow interval.


1. _Spongophortis spongiosa_, n. sp.

Cortical shell irregular, roundish, rough or tuberous, composed of loose
spongy framework, which immediately envelops the lentelliptical central
_Larnacilla_-shell; the diameter of the former becomes about five to six
times as large as that of the latter.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the spongy cortical shell 0.15 to 0.25, of the
trizonal medullary shell 0.03 to 0.04.

Cortical shell irregular, roundish, four to five times as large as the
enclosed lentelliptical _Larnacilla_-shell, with which it is connected by
ten to twenty irregularly disposed radial beams. Spongy framework compact,
about as thick as the medullary shell. Surface covered with numerous short,
bristle-shaped, radial spines.

trizonal medullary shell 0.035 to 0.045.

3. _Spongophortis larnacilla_, n. sp. (Pl. 49, figs. 11_a_-11_d_).

Cortical shell irregular, roundish, tuberous, three to four times as large
as the enclosed lentelliptical _Larnacilla_-shell, connected with it by two
opposite latticed wings (the halves of the transverse girdle of
_Tetrapyle_). Spongy framework compact, about half as thick as the
medullary shell. Surface rough. (May be regarded as an abnormal _Tetrapyle_
or _Larnacalpis_, with an irregular spongy cortical shell.)

trizonal medullary shell 0.04 to 0.06.

{712}Family XXXII. #SOREUMIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 49, figs. 12, 13).

_Soreumida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 464.

_Definition._--#Larcoidea# with quite irregular polythalamous shell,
composed of a variable number of chambers, aggregated without any definite
order. Primordial chamber either simple or _Larnacilla_-shaped.

The family #Soreumida# contains a small number of #Larcoidea#, different
from most other #Sphærellaria# in the complete irregularity of the
polythalamous shell, which is composed of a variable number of roundish
chambers or subspherical latticed shells, aggregated in the form of an
irregular heap. We can distinguish in this family only two genera, with
very different structure of the central medullary shell or the first
chamber beginning the growth; and these correspond to the two subfamilies
of the nearly allied Streblonida (p. 704). In _Soreuma_ (as in
_Streblonia_) the first or primordial chamber, from which the growth
begins, is like the others, a simple spherical or irregular roundish
lattice-shell. In _Sorolarcus_, however (as in _Streblopyle_), the first or
primordial chamber is a trizonal or _Larnacilla_-shell. It is not
improbable that the former originated phylogenetically from _Streblonia_,
the latter from _Streblopyle_, by loss of the original spiral order of
growth. But it is also possible that these groups have no nearer relation.
Among the calcareous Foraminifera a very similar form is represented by
_Acervulina_ and its allies.

The general form of the whole shell in the Soreumida is sometimes more
egg-shaped or lentelliptical, at other times even subspherical,
occasionally quite irregular, tuberous, or clustered. The number of the
aggregated chambers is very variable, in _Sorolarcus_ between ten and
thirty, in _Soreuma_ ascending to fifty to eighty, sometimes from one
hundred to one hundred and fifty and more. Their size is sometimes nearly
equal, at other times very different, their form commonly very irregular,
roundish, but sometimes also subspherical or egg-shaped. The network of the
shell is also commonly irregular, with roundish pores of different sizes.
The surface is usually smooth or rough, rarely covered with radial spines.

The central capsule is not known, as I observed only a few skeletons of
this family.

{713}The genus _Soreuma_ contains those Soreumida in which no trace of any
regular structure is found, but all the chambers of the irregular shell are
without any order, aggregated around a simple spherical or subspherical
central chamber or medullary shell. _Soreuma_ may have originated either
from _Sorolarcus_ by loss of the central _Larnacilla_-shell or from
_Cenolarcus_ by irregular apposition of new chambers around the
lentelliptical central chamber or simple Larcoid-shell. Some species seem
to exhibit a transition to _Sorolarcus_. Owing to the absolute irregularity
of the polythalamous shell _Soreuma_ resembles _Acervulina_ among the
Foraminifera.

irregular, roundish chambers of very different sizes, the largest six to
eight times as broad as the smallest. Pores subregular, circular, twice as

subspherical chambers of nearly the same size. Pores subregular, circular,
twice as broad as the bars; on the equator of each chamber six to eight
pores. Surface thorny, covered with irregularly scattered conical radial

Genus 316. _Sorolarcus_,[356] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Soreumida# with numerous chambers, aggregated irregularly
around a trizonal medullary shell or _Larnacilla_-shell.

The genus _Sorolarcus_ comprises those Soreumida in which the heap of
irregularly aggregated chambers encloses a central trizonal medullary
shell, by which they demonstrate clearly their descent from Larnacida or
Pylonida. The lentelliptical medullary {715}shell exhibits quite the same
characteristic structure as that of _Larnacilla_, being composed of three
elliptical latticed girdles, perpendicular one to another. In some species
also the beginning of a second system of girdles is clearly indicated, so
that there can be no doubt as to their derivation from _Amphipyle_ or
_Tetrapyle_.

capsule, which is everywhere perforated by innumerable fine pores (disposed
either equally or symmetrically). Extracapsulum without phæodium. Skeleton
centrogenous (its growth proceeding from the centre), acanthinic (organic,
not siliceous). Fundamental form originally spherical.

The legion ACANTHARIA vel ACTIPYLEA, to the extent here defined, was
constituted by me, 1878, in my Protistenreich (p. 102) under the name
"PANACANTHA." A more accurate definition of this group was given in 1879 by
Hertwig under the name ACANTHOMETREA. Both names were replaced by me, 1881,
in my Prodromus (pp. 421, 465) by the more convenient name ACANTHARIA. This
legion comprises all those Radiolaria which were first described by
Johannes Müller, 1858, as _Acanthometrae_, and also an important part of
his _Haliomma_. In my Monograph (1862, pp. 371-424) I disposed them in
three families, Acanthometrida, Diploconida, and Dorataspida.

Although the number of genera and species in this legion is much increased
by the rich collection of the Challenger, we can divide all ACANTHARIA into
two different orders: #Acanthometra# (without complete lattice-shell) and
#Acanthophracta# (provided with a complete lattice-shell).

The ACANTHARIA agree with the SPUMELLARIA in the structure of the simple
capsule-membrane, which is perforated by numerous small pores (but
constantly devoid of the large main opening, which the NASSELLARIA and
PHÆODARIA possess, being hence united as "Merotrypasta"). We can therefore
unite both former legions as "Holotrypasta" (compare above, pp. 5, 6); but
in many ACANTHARIA (if not in all?) the numerous small pores of the
capsule-membrane exhibit a certain peculiar arrangement not observed in the
SPUMELLARIA; therefore the latter can be regarded as true "Peripylea" in
opposition to the former as "Actipylea."

The peculiar main character of all ACTIPYLEA or ACANTHARIA is determined by
the chemical constitution of their skeleton, which is not silex, but a
peculiar organic substance, called by me in 1862 "acanthin" (Monogr. d.
Radiol., pp. 30, 32). In all other Radiolaria the skeleton is composed of
silex or of a silicate. But besides this {717}chemical difference, an
important morphological character of the skeleton also separates the
ACANTHARIA from all other Radiolaria: in the latter the skeleton is never
centrogenous or arising from the centre of the capsule; in strict
opposition to this general fact the skeleton of all ACANTHARIA is
centrogenous, composed of radial spines, which arise from the central point
of the capsule and pierce its membrane. These characteristic "radial spines
of acanthin," arising from the centre, are never hollow (as formerly was
supposed), but constantly solid. Their form is extremely variable, and most
important for the distinction of genera and species; but more interesting
from a general point of view is their peculiar arrangement or disposition.

The regular disposition of twenty radial spines has general value almost
for all ACANTHARIA, with the exception only of the small group of
#Actinelida#. In this latter group the number of radial spines is either
more or less than twenty, and their disposition is either quite irregular
or follows a peculiar rule. The number of individuals of these
#Actinelida#, compared with that of the other ACANTHARIA, may be scarcely 1
per cent., whilst the latter have more than 99 per cent.; the number of
observed species is in the former about 5 per cent., in the latter about 95
per cent. Nevertheless the small group of #Actinelida# is very important,
being probably the ancestral group from which all other ACANTHARIA have
been phylogenetically derived. These other ACANTHARIA, with twenty
regularly disposed radial spines, represent the two large groups of
#Acanthonida# and #Acanthophracta#. For short and clear distinction of
these two groups of ACANTHARIA, we will call the #Actinelida# (with
irregular number and disposition of radial spines) Adelacantha, in
opposition to the Icosacantha (#Acanthonida# and #Acanthophracta#), which
all possess twenty regularly disposed radial spines.

Johannes Müller, the great zoologist, to whom we are indebted for the first
detection and accurate knowledge of the #Acanthometra#, already recognised
the regularity in the peculiar disposition of their twenty radial spines
(Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, 1858, pp. 12, 37). In honour of my
great master I have called this regular disposition the "Müllerian law of
spine disposition," and have given a full explanation of it in my Monograph
(1862, pp. 40-45, 371, 372). With regard to its general value for all
Icosacantha (#Acanthonida# and #Acanthophracta#), we might also call this
promorphological Müllerian law "the Icosacanthan law."

In 1862 I had already given the following precise definition of this
"Icosacanthan law" (_loc. cit._, p. 40):--"Between two poles of a spineless
axis are regularly disposed five parallel zones, each with four radial
spines; the four spines of each zone are equidistant one from another, and
also equidistant from each pole; and the four spines of each zone are so
alternating with those of each neighbouring zone, that all twenty spines
together lie in four meridian planes, which intersect one another at an
angle of 45°."  For the clear conception of this remarkable Müllerian law,
and for the complete understanding of its high value for the complicated
{718}morphology of all Icosacantha, it is the most profitable way to retain
constantly in mind for comparison the figure of a terrestrial globe with
its axis and zones. The axis of the globe is the spineless axis of all
Icosacantha, around which all twenty spines are symmetrically disposed; it
is perpendicular to the bisecting equatorial plane, in which lies the
middle of the five parallel zones; therefore the four spines, crossed
perpendicularly in this equatorial plane, are called the equatorial spines
(_c_1 to _c_4 in the figures of Pls. 131-140); often, and mainly in the
family Quadrilonchida (Pl. 131), these four equatorial spines are much
larger or of a peculiar form, different from that of the sixteen other
spines. Each pair of the four equatorial spines lies in one equatorial
axis, and this latter is perpendicular to the crossing axis, in which lies
the other pair of opposite spines. We may regard these two equatorial
diameters, perpendicular one to another and to the spineless axis, as the
two perradial axes or primary axes. Correspondingly the two meridian
planes, which are determined by one perradial axis and the spineless axis,
may be called the two primary or perradial meridian planes.

The globe is divided by the equatorial plane into two equal halves, the
northern and the southern hemisphere. In each hemisphere there are disposed
quite symmetrically eight radial spines, the distal ends of which fall in
two parallel circles, a larger tropical circle (nearer to the equator) and
a smaller polar circle (nearer to the pole of the spineless axis).
Therefore we call the four spines of the former the "tropical spines" and
the four spines of the latter the "polar spines." The angle between the
former and the equatorial plane is about 30°, the angle between the latter
and that plane about 60°.

The eight polar spines (four northern and four southern) lie in the same
two meridian planes as the four equatorial spines. Therefore in each of
these two perradial planes lie six radial spines, opposite in pairs; two
equatorial and four polar spines. Commonly all eight polar spines are of
the same size and form; and often they are also equal to the eight tropical
spines; but in some cases (e.g., in some species of Quadrilonchida) they
are much smaller than the twelve other spines, and sometimes even
rudimentary. In all figures of the Pls. 131-140 (and also in my Monograph,
1862, Taf. xv.-xxii.) the polar spines of the northern circle are marked by
the characters _a_1 to _a_4, the polar spines of the southern circle by the
characters _e_1 to _e_4. In the first perradial meridian plane lie _a_1 and
_a_3, _e_1 and _e_3, in the second _a_2 and _a_4, _e_2 and _e_4.

The eight tropical spines lie between the eight polar and the four
equatorial spines, four in each hemisphere; their distal points fall in two
parallel circles, which correspond exactly to the two tropics of the globe.
Therefore the four northern tropical spines may be called "canceral spines"
(as their ends fall in the Tropic of Cancer) and the four southern
correspondingly "capricornal spines" (as their points lie {719}in the
Tropic of the Capricorn). In the figures of the Pls. 131-140 (as well as in
my Monograph, 1862, Taf. xv.-xxii.) the four northern or canceral spines
are marked by the characters _b_1 to _b_4, and the four southern or
capricornal spines by the characters _d_1 to _d_4. Also the eight tropical
spines lie (crossed in pairs) in two meridian planes; they do not lie,
however, in those perradial planes, in which are placed the twelve other
spines; but in two different meridian planes, crossing the former at angles
of 45°; we call these the "secondary" or "interradial" meridian planes.
Each of these planes is determined by the spineless axis and by two crossed
interradial or secondary axes; in each of the latter lie two opposite
tropical spines. In the first interradial meridian plane lie _b_1 and _b_3,
_d_1 and _d_3, in the second _b_2 and _b_4, _d_2 and _d_4.

It is a most interesting and important fact, that in all Icosacantha
(#Acanthonida# and #Acanthophracta#) this regular disposition of the twenty
spines (in five parallel zones and four meridian planes) becomes constantly
preserved by heredity, whilst the form and size of the different spines are
extremely varied by adaptation.

Only  in a minority of the Icosacantha are all twenty spines perfectly
equal or nearly equal in size and form; and then it is often very difficult
to distinguish the different zones in their disposition. But in far the
greater part the size or the form of the twenty spines becomes different in
different zones; and then we can commonly distinguish easily the five
different zones. Firstly, in all Quadrilonchida and Dorataspida, the four
equatorial are distinguished from the sixteen other spines either by form
or by size, and often in a very remarkable degree. As soon as these four
principal spines are recognised, it is easy to determine also the sixteen
others; for the eight polar spines lie in the same two (perradial) meridian
planes as the former, whilst the eight tropical spines lie in two different
(interradial) meridian planes, intersecting the two former at angles of
45°. Commonly, therefore, this distinction is rather easy.

In the majority of the Icosacantha all four equatorial spines are exactly
of the same form and size. But in four families the two opposite spines of
one equatorial axis are much larger, or of another form, than those of the
crossing axis. This is the case in the Amphilonchida, Belonaspida,
Hexalaspida, and Diploconida. Therefore we here call the major equatorial
axis (with larger spines) the "hydrotomical axis," and the minor axis (with
smaller spines) the "geotomical axis." Correspondingly, the meridian plane,
 in which the two larger equatorial spines are placed (_c_1, _c_3) and the
appertaining four polar spines (_a_1, _a_3, _e_1, _e_3) may be called the
"hydrotomical plane"; in the remarkable family of Hexalaspida (Pl. 139) all
six spines of this hydrotomical plane are much larger than the other
fourteen. Perpendicular to this plane is the second perradial meridian
plane, which we call the "geotomical plane"; in it lie the two smaller
equatorial spines (c2, c4) and the corresponding four polar spines (_a_2,
_a_4, _e_2, _e_4). In some Hexalaspida (_Hexonaspis_ and _Hexacolpus_) the
six spines of the hydrotomical plane become so preponderant that {720}the
other fourteen spines appear rudimentary; and in some of them the two
equatorial spines of the hydrotomical plane are much larger than the four
polar spines of the same plane. This curious relation reaches its maximum
in the Diploconida (Pl. 140).

The different development of the two equatorial axes (of the larger
hydrotomical and the smaller geotomical axis) is the first and most
important cause of the peculiar forms, which are produced in the four cited
families. We derive these terms also from the metaphor of the terrestrial
globe. The hydrotomical plane is that meridian plane of the globe which
intersects almost only the water-hemisphere (the island of Ferro in the
Atlantic, the island of Pandora in the Pacific). Perpendicular to this is
the geotomical plane, the meridian of which intersects great land-masses in
both hemispheres (Bombay in India, Athabasca in Canada). Both poles of the
smaller geotomical axis are everywhere equal (the East Indian and the
Western American). However, both poles of the larger hydrotomical axis (the
eastern Atlantic and the western Pacific) are in some genera very
different, _e.g._, in _Amphibelone_ among the Amphilonchida, and in
_Zygostaurus_ among the Quadrilonchida. In this case we call the anterior
(commonly more developed) pole of the hydrotomical axis the frontal pole,
the opposite posterior (commonly smaller) the caudal pole (Pl. 131, figs.
7, 8; Pl. 132, figs. 9, 10). On both sides of these (right and left) lie
symmetrically the two equal poles of the geotomical lateral axis.

The promorphology of the ACANTHARIA demonstrates that the geometrical
fundamental form in those groups is different. In the majority of the
ACANTHARIA, where the two equatorial axes are equal, that form is a double
square-pyramid or a "quadrate octahedron"; the four equal equatorial spines
indicate the two diagonals of the square, which is the common base of the
united regular four-sided pyramids; their common axis is the spineless axis
of the body; the ends of the polar spines fall on the edges of the
pyramids, while the ends of the tropical spines fall on the halving lines
of their faces. However, in those ACANTHARIA in which the two equatorial
axes become different, the square double pyramid becomes changed into a
rhombic double pyramid; the common base of the united pyramids is thus a
rhombus; the hydrotomical axis is the larger, the geotomical axis the
smaller diagonal of the rhombus.

Opposed to the Icosacantha, under the name "Adelacantha," is the small
group of Actinelida, in which the number and disposition of the radial
spines is variable, not determined by the Müllerian law. Probably this
group is the common ancestral stock, from which the Icosacantha have been
derived by gradual development of their peculiar disposition. Probably the
oldest and most primitive form of all ACANTHARIA is _Actinelius_, in which
a variable and undetermined (often very large) number of radial spines is
united in one common central point, and therefore forms a needle-sphere.
Whilst here all spines (often more than a hundred) are of equal size and
form, in the nearly allied _Astrolophus_ large and small spines are
intermingled. Both genera together form the small ancestral family of
Astrolophida. In the strange family of Litholophida the radial spines do
not {721}radiate within a spherical space (equally disposed in all
directions), but within a quadrant or even an octant, forming a conical
brush or pencil.

One very remarkable form of #Actinelida# is _Actinastrum_, forming the
transition from these Adelacantha to the common regular Icosacantha. In the
two observed species of _Actinastrum_ we find thirty-two radial spines,
twenty of which are disposed after the Müllerian law, as in the
Icosacantha. The other twelve are four interradial equatorial spines (lying
in the two secondary meridian planes) and eight perradial tropical spines
(lying in the two primary meridian planes). Therefore here in each primary
meridian plane are placed ten spines (two equatorial, four tropical, and
four polar spines), whereas in each secondary meridian plane are placed six
spines (two equatorial and four tropical). But here also all thirty-two
spines are so regularly placed that their free distal ends fall into five
parallel zones, four in each polar zone, eight in each tropical zone, and
eight in the equatorial zone.

_The Central Junction_ of the radial spines in the ACANTHARIA becomes
effected in four different ways:--(1) by simple apposition of the pyramidal
central ends or bases; (2) by a basal leaf-cross, or by broad wings, four
on each spine, supported one upon the other; (3) by a central concrescence
of the meeting bases of all the twenty spines, growing perfectly together;
and (4) by a concrescence in pairs of every two opposite spines. The most
common and probably the original mode of junction is the first--by
pyramidal apposition; the spines at the central base are pointed in the
form of a pyramid, and the triangular faces of the neighbouring pyramids
are simply placed upon one another. Often the small basal pyramids are
imperfectly separated from the spines by an annular constriction. Commonly
the basal pyramids of the four equatorial spines are six-sided, those of
the sixteen other spines five-sided.

The second mode of junction, by a basal leaf-cross, is developed from the
first and appears as a strengthening or a mechanical elaboration of it.
Immediately above the basal pyramid arise from its radial edges four thin
and broad triangular leaves or wings, and the meeting edges of the
neighbouring wings are in apposition one with the other, so that between
the bases of every three or four neighbouring spines a hollow pyramidal
space remains open. The apex of such a pyramidal space is directed towards
the centre of the body, but separated from it by the small basal pyramid;
its open base is directed outwards. The twenty-two hollow pyramidal spaces
are disposed regularly in four different groups:--(A) Four equatorial
spaces, four-sided, each limited by two equatorial and two tropical spines
(one canceral and one capricornal); (B) eight perizonal spaces (four
northern and four southern), four-sided, each limited by one equatorial,
two tropical, and one polar spine; (C) eight peripolar spaces (four
northern and four southern), three-sided, each limited by one tropical and
two polar spines; (D) two polar spaces (one northern and one southern),
four-sided, each limited by four neighbouring polar spines.

{722}The third mode of junction, by central concrescence of all twenty
spines, was formerly regarded by me as an important peculiarity, sufficient
for the separation of subfamilies and genera (Monogr. d. Radiol., 1862, pp.
399, 401; Prodromus, 1881, p. 466). But I found afterwards that in many
species where the twenty spines commonly remain separated, accidentally
they grow perfectly together and form one single piece of acanthin--a
starrulet with twenty rays. Therefore I now think it is more natural to
divide those species only into different subgenera.

A fourth and a very different mode of junction, quite sufficient for the
distinction of different families, is the concrescence in pairs of every
two opposite spines, lying in one diameter (in _Acanthochiasma_ and
_Chiastolus_). Here we obtain a number of "diametral spines" (each composed
of two originally opposed radial spines) and all these diametral spines are
crossed loosely near the central point of the body without any solid and
permanent apposition (Chiastolida). However, in some species of this
peculiar family the central part of the diametral spines is twisted like a
screw or spirally convoluted (Pl. 129, figs. 2, 3).

_The Form of the Radial Spines_ in the ACANTHARIA is extremely varied, and
constitutes the main characters for the distinction of nearly four hundred
species. But all these different forms may be reduced phylogenetically to
three different fundamental forms:--(_a_) the cylindrical (with circular
transverse section), (_b_) the two-edged (with elliptical or lanceolate
transverse section), and (_c_) the four-edged (with square transverse
section). No doubt the first (_a_) is the original primitive form, from
which the two others are secondarily derived. Triangular spines never occur
in the ACANTHARIA, whilst, however, they are common in the #Sphærellaria#.
The first and original form, the cylindrical spine, is either a true
cylinder of equal thickness in its whole length, or it is more or less
conical. Rarely the spine is in the distal half spindle-shaped, and thicker
than in the basal half. The second form, the two-edged spine, is more or
less compressed from two opposite sides; its two edges are either more
blunt, rounded, or more acute, sharp; its transverse section in the former
case is elliptical, in the latter case lanceolate or rhomboidal. Sometimes
the two edges are broader and in the form of two thin opposite wings. The
two-edged spines may be occasionally shorter, triangular or lanceolate, at
other times longer sword-shaped or linear. The third form, the four-edged
spine, has constantly a square transverse section; the sides of this square
are either even or concave; in the latter case the four edges are broadened
and wing-like, but in the former case not. The quadrangular spines are
either prismatic (of equal breadth throughout their whole length) or
pyramidal (becoming gradually thinner towards the distal apex).

_The Apex of the Radial Spines_, or their free distal end, is in the
majority of ACANTHARIA simple, conical. In the minority it is either
truncated or bifid, or four-sided pyramidal, often with two, rarely with
four prominent parallel teeth. In some forms {723}the bifid spines are so
deeply cleft that they become forked. Much more interesting and more varied
than these different forms of the distal end are those of the apophyses of
the radial spines.

_The Apophyses of the Radial Spines_, or their "lateral transverse
processes," are of the greatest importance for the morphological
development of the whole subclass. Only in sixteen among the sixty-five
genera of ACANTHARIA are the apophyses perfectly wanting; in the other
genera they determine in the first place their general character. In the
#Acanthometra# the apophyses remain perfectly free, whilst in the
#Acanthophracta# their meeting ends or branches compose the latticed shell.
All differences in form and shape of the apophyses can be reduced to only
two primary modes; either the spine bears two opposite or four crossed
apophyses; correspondingly all Acantharia apophysaria may be divided into
two different main groups, the Zygapophysica (with two opposite lateral
processes) and the Staurapophysica (with four crossed lateral processes
opposite in pairs). Both groups have probably no direct phylogenetic
connection, but seem to be derived independently from different stocks, and
produce different families. The Zygapophysica are probably derived from
Astrolonchida with two-edged spines (_Zygacantha_), and from this group
arise the Diporaspida, the ancestral group of the majority of
#Acanthophracta#. On the other hand the Staurapophysica are probably
derived from Astrolonchida with four-edged spines (_Acanthonia_), and from
this group arise the Tessaraspida. The apophyses of the #Acanthonida# are
partly simple, partly branched or even latticed; the apophyses of the
#Acanthophracta# are never simple, constantly branched and commonly
latticed.

_The Malacoma_ (or the whole soft body of the ACANTHARIA as opposed to the
skeleton) exhibits some peculiarities which distinguish them from the other
Radiolaria, as well in the structure of the central capsule and its nucleus
as in that of the enveloping extracapsular body and the pseudopodia.

The _Central Capsule_ is constantly spherical in the far greater number of
the ACANTHARIA, viz., in the following six families:--Astrolophida,
Chiastolida, Astrolonchida, Dorataspida, Sphærocapsida, and Phractopeltida.
Among these six families the Astrolonchida and Dorataspida are far greater
and far richer in different forms than all the other families. The central
capsule becomes ellipsoidal or cylindrical, prolonged in one axis, in the
three families, Amphilonchida, Belonapsida, and Diploconida; it becomes
discoidal or lenticular, by the shortening of one axis, in two families,
viz., in the Quadrilonchida and Hexalaspida. Finally, the peculiar family
Litholophida is distinguished by the conical form of its central capsule.

_The Membrane_ of the central capsule in all ACANTHARIA is simple, commonly
thin, sometimes very delicate; in some species it seems to be developed
late, just immediately before the formation of the spores; but in no
species is it completely missing. The membrane is constantly pierced by
innumerable fine pores, for the emission of the {724}pseudopodia; but in
many species (and probably more or less in all ACANTHARIA) there is
recognisable a certain regularity in the disposition of the numerous
pseudopodia and of the pores by which they radiate from the capsule.
Sometimes these pores are disposed in a regular network of ramified lines,
whilst the meshes of this network are devoid of pores; in other cases they
form regular tufts or bushes between the radial spines. Probably in no
ACANTHARIA are the pores of the capsule membrane so numerous and so equally
distributed throughout as in the SPUMELLARIA; we may therefore call the
former ACTIPYLEA (in opposition to the latter, as PERIPYLEA).

_The Nucleus_ of the ACANTHARIA is constantly excentric, whilst it is
originally constantly central in the SPUMELLARIA. This excentric position
is a necessary consequence of the centrogenous development of the radial
spines. Probably connected with this peculiarity is the other, that the
nucleus assumes a peculiar, complicated structure, and that in the greater
number of ACANTHARIA it becomes cleft very early, and that this cleavage is
effected by a peculiar kind of gemmation, first detected and very
accurately described by R. Hertwig (compare his Organismus d. Radiol.,
1879, pp. 10-24). However, in the young ACANTHARIA the nucleus is
constantly simple, and in a certain number of species its cleavage takes
place late (as in the greater number of SPUMELLARIA).

_The Endoplasm_, or the intracapsular sarcode, exhibits in the greater
number of ACANTHARIA a more or less distinct radial arrangement; but this
is often concealed by the different enclosed products of the
endoplasm--oil-globules, vacuoles, red or different coloured
pigment-granules, crystals, &c. Often it encloses a variable number of
"yellow cells" (becoming green by mineral acids) to be considered as
symbiotic xanthellæ.

_The Calymma_ or the jelly-veil, including the central capsule, in the
ACANTHARIA is more or less voluminous, and commonly envelops the skeleton
perfectly. In its surface is sometimes developed a peculiar network of
"supporting fibres." A very peculiar product are the remarkable
"Myophrisca" of the #Acanthometra#, which are wanting in the
#Acanthophracta#; they were first detected by Johannes Müller, and figured
as "Cilien-Kränze," afterwards explained by Hertwig as "contractile Fäden,"
similar to muscular fibrillæ (compare below).

_The Matrix_, placed between the calymma and central capsule, in the
majority of the ACANTHARIA is a rather thin layer of granular exoplasm.

_The Pseudopodia_ arising from it are not so numerous as in the
SPUMELLARIA, and not so equally disposed over the whole surface. Also their
tendency to ramify, anastomose, and form networks seems to be much less
developed. Commonly they are simple or little ramified. In many cases (and
perhaps everywhere) there may be distinguished two different kinds of
pseudopodia:--(1) Axopodia, or permanent pseudopodia (with axial
filaments?), piercing the wall of the central capsule, and arising from the
central mass of endoplasm; and (2) Collopodia, or variable pseudopodia
(without axial filaments), arising outside the capsule from the matrix of
extracapsular sarcode or from the {725}exoplasm on the surface of the
calymma. These and other differentiations seem to indicate that the
pseudopodia in the ACANTHARIA are more highly developed than in the
SPUMELLARIA, and justify the denomination of the former as "Actipylea."

_Definition._--ACANTHARIA without complete latticed shell.

The order #Acanthometra#, the third order of Radiolaria, comprises all
those ACANTHARIA in which the acanthinic skeleton is only composed of
radial spines arising from one common central point, but never forms a
complete latticed shell. By the absence of such a latticed or fenestrated
shell the #Acanthometra# differ principally from the nearly allied
#Acanthophracta#, the second order of ACANTHARIA, which constantly possess
such a complete shell.

Johannes Müller, who first detected and described the #Acanthometra# (in
1855, _loc. cit._), defined them as follows:--"Radiolaria without shell,
with siliceous radial spines" (1858, Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin,
p. 46). He described and figured eighteen species of them, disposed in four
genera (_Acanthometra_ with fifteen species, and _Zygacantha_,
_Lithophyllium_, _Lithoptera_, each with a single species). Among those
eighteen species, however, were two "Acanthometræ cataphractæ,"
appertaining to the following order, the #Acanthophracta#.

In my Monograph (1862, p. 371) all true #Acanthometra# were united into a
single family, Acanthometrida, with the following definition:--"Skeleton
composed of a number of radial spines, piercing the central capsule and
united in its centre, without {726}latticed shell." In the majority of them
I observed that the skeleton did not consist of silex, but of a very
peculiar organic substance, which I called "acanthin." At that time I
divided the family Acanthometrida into four subfamilies:--(1)
Acanthostaurida, (2) Astrolithida, (3) Litholophida, (4) Acanthochiasmida.
The two former now represent the suborder #Acanthonida#, the two latter the
suborder #Actinelida#. The number of genera which I distinguished in my
Monograph amounted to nine, the number of species to fifty. By the rich
collections of the Challenger this number is so much increased that we can
here describe twenty-seven genera and one hundred and sixty species.

Richard Hertwig in his work on the Organismus der Radiolarien (1879, pp.
6-25) adopted my family Acanthometrida, and gave a very accurate
description of its anatomical structure. He confirmed my observations that
the radial spines of this family are never hollow, but solid, and that
their chemical substance is not silex, but the organic matter "acanthin."
He found that the simple nucleus of the Acanthometrida is commonly very
early cleft, and that the peculiar brushes of filaments on the calymma,
described by Johannes Müller and by me as "Gallert-cilien," are peculiar
"contractile filaments," comparable to the "muscle-fibrillæ" of some
Infusoria, or the "Myophan-filaments" (Myophrisca).

The order #Acanthometra# is here divided into two different suborders of
very unequal extent and value, the #Actinelida# and #Acanthonida#. The
first may be regarded as the common ancestral stock, not only of the
second, but of all ACANTHARIA. In the small group of #Actinelida# the
number of radial spines is variable and commonly indefinite, often very
large (more than a hundred); they are therefore Adelacantha. The second
suborder, the #Acanthonida#, comprise by far the greatest part of the
order, and possess constantly twenty radial spines, regularly disposed
after the Müllerian law; they are therefore (like all #Acanthophracta#)
Icosacantha (compare above, p. 717).

The #Actinelida# possess constantly simple radial spines, without any
apophyses; their form is commonly very simple and primitive. This suborder
comprises three small but very different families, the Astrolophida,
Litholophida, and Chiastolida. The first family, the Astrolophida, is the
original ancestral group. A large and variable, commonly indefinite number
of radial spines is here united in the centre of the spherical central
capsule and radiating within a spherical space. In the second family, the
Litholophida, a small and variable number of radial spines (between ten and
twenty) is united in the apex of a conical central capsule and radiating
within the quadrant or octant of a spherical space. In the third family,
the Chiastolida, a variable number of radial spines is grown together by
pairs, in such a manner that every two opposite spines (placed originally
in one axis of the spherical central capsule) forms a single "diametral
spine"; all these diametral spines are not united in the centre of the
central capsule but only crossed loosely near the centre.

{727}The #Acanthonida#, the second suborder of #Acanthometra#, embraces by
far the greatest number in this order, viz., all those forms in which
twenty radial spines are regularly disposed after the Müllerian
law--Icosacantha (compare above, p. 717). The radial spines of this
suborder are either simple or provided with transverse processes (either
two opposite or four crossed apophyses). They are commonly united in the
middle of the central capsule by their opposed basal ends, forming small
pyramids; the meeting triangular faces of the neighbouring pyramids being
propped one upon another. Above these small basal pyramids often arises a
basal leaf-cross formed by four broad triangular leaves or wings with
straight edges; the meeting thin edges of the neighbouring spines serve for
strengthening the basal junction and form hollow pyramidal spaces or
compartments, filled with the contents of the central capsule (compare p.
721). The suborder #Acanthonida# comprises three different families, the
Astrolonchida, Quadrilonchida, and Amphilonchida. The first family, the
Astrolonchida, comprises by far the greater number of the #Acanthonida#;
those genera in which all twenty spines are perfectly equal or nearly equal
in size and form. In the second family, the Quadrilonchida, the four
equatorial spines are much larger (and often also of another form) than the
sixteen other spines (often also the eight tropical larger than the eight
polar spines). The third family, the Amphilonchida, is distinguished by the
preponderating development of only two opposite equatorial spines, which
are much larger (and often also of another form) than the eighteen other
spines.

Suborder I. ACTINELIDA, Haeckel, 1882.

_Definition._--#Acanthometra# with a variable number of radial spines,
which are commonly irregularly disposed, not according to the Icosacantha.



Family XXXIII. #ASTROLOPHIDA#, Haeckel.

_Astrolophida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 469.

_Definition._--#Acantharia# with a variable number of simple radial spines,
radiating within a spherical space from one common central point which is
the centre of the spherical central capsule. No lattice shell.

The family #Astrolophida# comprises the simplest and the most primitive
forms among all ACANTHARIA, and may therefore be regarded as the common
ancestral stock of this whole legion or subclass of Radiolaria. The
acanthinic skeleton is composed of a variable number of quite simple radial
spines, which are united in the centre of the spherical central capsule and
radiate, piercing its walls and the surrounding jelly-veil, within a
spherical space.

The first observed form of this family is the ancestral genus _Actinelius_,
two different species of which I detected in 1864 in the northern
Mediterranean, at Villafranca, near Nice (compare Zeitschr. f. wiss. Zool.,
1865, Bd. xv. p. 364, Taf. xxvi. fig. 4). Three other species of the same
genus were afterwards found by me in the Challenger collections. Whilst in
this _Actinelius_ all radial spines are of the same size, a new nearly
allied genus, _Astrolophus_ (with two species), differs from it by the
different size of the radial spines, a small number of very large spines
being intermingled with a very large number of small spines. In these two
genera, _Actinelius_ and _Astrolophus_ (the true "Astrolophida" _sensu
strictiori_), the number of the radial spines is quite indeterminable and
their arrangement quite irregular and variable.

A third remarkable genus, _Actinastrum_, differs from these two genera in
the definite number and regular order  of thirty-two radial spines, and may
therefore perhaps better represent a peculiar family, Actinastrida. In this
genus (of which two species were observed) the thirty-two radial spines are
disposed in such a regular manner that they lie in four meridian planes,
and that their distal ends fall into five parallel zones. These five zones
and these four planes are the same as we find in all Icosacantha (compare
above, p. 717). Also the constant twenty spines of these latter are present
in _Actinastrum_; but their number is here enlarged by twelve other spines
missing in the Icosacantha; four of these are secondary or interradial
equatorial spines, lying opposite in pairs between the four primary or
perradial equatorial spines; and eight are perradial tropical spines, lying
between the eight interradial tropical spines. Therefore the {729}distal
ends of the thirty-two radial spines are disposed regularly in five
parallel zones, and while two zones (the two polar) contain only the points
of every four spines, three zones (the single equatorial and the two
tropical) contain the points of every eight spines. The four meridian
planes are in _Actinastrum_ the same as in the Icosacantha, crossed in the
spineless axis at angles of 45°. But in the Icosacantha each of the two
perradial meridian planes contains six radial spines (two equatorial and
four polar), each of the two interradial meridian planes only four tropical
spines. Whereas in _Actinastrum_ each of the two primary or perradial
meridian planes contains ten spines (two equatorial, four tropical, and
four polar), each of the two secondary or interradial meridian planes six
spines (two equatorial and four tropical). We find therefore altogether
thirty-two radial spines in three orders; eight equatorial, sixteen
tropical, and eight polar spines.

Only one other genus of Radiolaria exhibits the same characteristic
disposition of thirty-two radial spines as _Actinastrum_, and this is
_Chiastolus_; but here the two opposite spines of each pair are grown
together and form one diametral spine; and the sixteen diametral spines are
crossed in the centre of the capsule. In _Actinastrum_, as in _Astrolophus_
and _Actinelius_, the central ends or bases of all the spines are
pyramidal, and the triangular faces of the neighbouring spines rest one
upon another (as in the greater number of #Acanthonida#). The form of the
radial spines in all Astrolophida is quite simple, without lateral
processes or apophyses; chiefly cylindrical, more rarely compressed,
two-edged or quadrangular.

The central capsule in all Astrolophida is spherical, and in the younger
specimens contains a single large concentric and lobed nucleus, but in the
older specimens a large number of small nuclei. The surrounding jelly-veil
or calymma seems commonly to envelop the spines perfectly. The piercing
pseudopodia radiate everywhere between the spines, and are very numerous
and thin. The circulating granules in them are sometimes red (_Actinelius
purpureus_).

_Definition._--#Astrolophida# with a variable and undetermined number of
simple radial spines, all of equal size, united in the centre of the
spherical central capsule.

{730}The genus _Actinelius_ comprises the most simple and primitive forms
among all ACANTHARIA, and may be regarded as the common ancestral stock of
this whole legion. The spherical central capsule is pierced by numerous
simple radial spines of equal size, the pyramidal bases of which are
supported one upon another with their triangular faces in the centre of the
capsule. The number and position of the spines are quite indefinite and
variable. We may derive _Actinelius_ either from _Actissa_ (#Colloidea#) by
development of acanthinic radial spines, or directly from _Actinosphærium_
(Heliozoa) by formation of a central capsule.

of this species are similar to those of {731}_Actinastrum pentazonium_ (p.
733) and of _Chiastolus amphicopium_ (Pl. 129, fig. 3), but much more
numerous, smaller, and not regularly disposed. These latter two Actinelida
must be separated on account of the regular disposition of the thirty-two
spines.

_Definition._--#Astrolophida# with a variable and undetermined number of
simple radial spines of different sizes (large and small spines
intermingled), which are united in the centre of the spherical central
capsule.

The genus _Astrolophus_ differs from the nearly allied ancestral genus
_Actinelius_ only in the unequal size of the numerous radial spines. In
both observed species very numerous small spines are intermingled with a
small number of large spines, and between them numerous spines of medium
size. The small spines fill up the hollow spaces between the basal parts of
the large spines.


{732}1. _Astrolophus stellaris_, n. sp.

Radial spines from one hundred to two hundred, of very different sizes, but
of similar form; about sixteen to twenty very large spines, forty to fifty
of medium size, and one hundred to one hundred and twenty much smaller. All
spines cylindrical in the greater part of their length, with simple apex,
gradually thickened towards the central part, conical, without edges. The
base itself is a slender pyramid with four to eight edges.

_Dimensions._--Length of the largest spines 0.3 to 0.4, of the majority 0.1
to 0.2, of the smallest 0.05 to 0.1.

2. _Astrolophus solaris_, n. sp. (Pl. 132, figs. 12_a_, 12_b_).

Radial spines from two hundred to three hundred, of very different sizes,
but of similar form; about twenty to thirty very large spines, sixty to
eighty of medium size, and one hundred and twenty to one hundred and fifty
much smaller. All spines cylindrical in the greater part of their length,
with simple apex, gradually thickened and four-edged towards the central
base. The base itself is a slender pyramid with four to eight edges; partly
the faces, partly the edges of these basal pyramids rest one upon another,
the points of the larger spines meeting in the centre.

_Dimensions._--Length of the largest spines 0.4 to 0.5, of the majority 0.2
to 0.3, of the smallest 0.1 to 0.16; basal thickness of the largest spines

_Habitat._--South-east Pacific (off Juan Fernandez), Station 296, surface.



Genus 319. _Actinastrum_,[359] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Astrolophida# with thirty-two simple radial spines,
regularly disposed within four meridian planes in such an order that their
distal ends fall into five parallel zones. Central ends of the thirty-two
spines supported one upon another in the centre of the spherical central
capsule.

The genus _Actinastrum_ differs from the two preceding genera in the
definite number and order of the thirty-two radial spines, which are
disposed in a very remarkable manner. Twenty radial spines are disposed
after the Müllerian law of Icosacantha (compare above, p. 717). The
remaining twelve spines are four equatorial spines lying in the two
secondary meridian planes, and eight tropical spines lying in the two
primary meridian planes. We have therefore together eight equatorial,
sixteen tropical, and eight polar spines (compare above, p. 729).


{733}1. _Actinastrum legitimum_, n. sp.

All thirty-two radial spines of equal size and similar form, cylindrical,
conical at the distal end, at the central base pyramidal. Central capsule
pellucid, colourless.

_Dimensions._--Length of the radial spines 0.3, breadth 0.004.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 288, surface.


2. _Actinastrum pentazonium_, n. sp.

All thirty-two radial spines of equal size and similar form, compressed,
two-edged, gradually becoming broader and thinner from the pyramidal
central base towards the truncated distal end. Central capsule dark,
opaque. (Compare the similar _Chiastolus amphicopium_, Pl. 129, fig. 3.)

_Dimensions._--Length of the radial spines 0.2, breadth at the base 0.005,
at the distal end 0.02.

_Habitat._--South Pacific (west coast of Patagonia), Station 302, surface.



Family XXXIV. LITHOLOPHIDA, Haeckel.

_Litholophida_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 401.

_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with a variable number of simple radial spines
radiating within a conical space (or within the quadrant of a sphere) from
one common central point, which is the apex of the conical central capsule.
No lattice-shell.

The family #Litholophida#, represented only by a single genus,
_Litholophus_, differs from all other ACANTHARIA in the remarkable fact
that the common point, from which the radial spines arise, is not the
geometrical central point of the whole body, but is quite excentric in
position, the apex of the conical or pyramidal central capsule. Therefore
the spines form together a kind of brush or broom.

When I founded the family Litholophida in my Monograph (1862, p. 401) I
knew only a single species, _Litholophus rhipidium_, observed very
frequently in Messina. Another species, _Litholophus ligurinus_, was
afterwards (1864) found by me at Nice. Six other species were detected in
the preparations of the Challenger, some of them very frequent. All these
eight species of _Litholophus_ are very nearly allied, and exhibit only
slight differences in the form and number of the radial spines; their mode
of excentric connection and the structure of the peculiar soft body is
everywhere the same.

The radial spines in all observed Litholophida possess the form of the
genus _Acanthonia_, _i.e._, they are quite simple, four-sided prismatic or
quadrangular, with square transverse section; their four edges are
sometimes smooth, at other times elegantly denticulate, commonly more or
less prominent or wing-shaped. In the greater number of species they are
very long and of nearly equal breadth, prismatic; in some species they are
more pyramidal, thinned towards the distal end; the latter {734}is commonly
truncated or broken off, sometimes pyramidal. The central end is everywhere
thinned, more or less pyramidal, and the neighbouring spines are propped
one upon another by the triangular faces of their small basal pyramids. A
slight pressure is sufficient to destroy their connection.

The number and disposition of the radial spines seem to be variable and
irregular, but require further researches. In four of the observed eight
species I found constantly ten spines, in two other species from ten to
twenty (commonly twelve or sixteen), and in two species twenty or more. A
certain order or disposition of the spines within the conical space in
which they radiate could nowhere be ascertained.

When I first observed _Litholophus_, I supposed that it might only be a
mutilated or altered form of an _Acanthonia_. Afterwards, observing many
specimens with ten spines, I was led to the suggestion that they were
produced by self-division of an _Acanthonia_, and that the number of the
spines in each half of the body might be afterwards doubled. But this
suggestion seems to be refuted by the fact that in no other genus of the
numerous ACANTHARIA is self-division observed, and that many hundreds of
_Litholophus_ which I observed exhibit quite constantly only a single form
of radial spines, that of _Acanthonia_--simple quadrangular spines without
any apophyses.



Genus 320. _Litholophus_,[360] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 401.

_Definition._--#Litholophida# with a variable number of quadrangular
diverging radial spines, united with pyramidal bases in the apex of the
conical central capsule.

The genus _Litholophus_, the only one of this family, exhibits the
peculiarities just described, but might more nearly be defined as a typical
"genus" by the quadrangular form of the radial spines, identical with those
of _Acanthonia_.

The central capsule of _Litholophus_ is constantly conical or pyramidal,
commonly opaque, of a dark brownish or reddish colour; it contains many
small nuclei. It envelops the basal half of all radial spines in such a
manner that their basal parts are united in its apex, and their distal
parts pierce the rounded base of the conical capsule (Pl. 129, fig. 2).

The calymma or the jelly envelope of the central capsule is only developed
at its base, where the spines radiate; at the conical mantle of the capsule
it is very thin. The spines seem to be perfectly enclosed in the calymma
and connected with it by the same contractile retinacula or "myophrisca"
which we observe in the #Acanthonida#. The pseudopodia arise only from the
rounded base of the conical capsule, and radiate between the spines,
piercing the calymma, diverging within the conical space occupied by the
fascicle of spines.

Family XXXV. #CHIASTOLIDA#, Haeckel.

_Acanthochiasmida_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 402.

_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with a variable number of simple radial spines,
which are grown together in pairs (two opposite spines of each pair
representing together a single diametral spine). Diametral spines crossed
loosely in the centre of the spherical or irregular roundish central
capsule. No lattice-shell.

{737}The family #Chiastolida# (or Acanthochiasmida) differs from all other
ACANTHARIA in the peculiar mode of the radial spines; these grown together
in pairs in the centre of the body, so that every two spines opposite in
one axis of the body form together one single diametral spine. All
diametral spines are loosely crossed in the middle of the central capsule,
or connected by a peculiar screw-like winding, but not united firmly.

I established the family Acanthochiasmida in my Monograph (1862, p. 402)
upon the single genus _Acanthochiasma_ (with three species), in which only
ten diametral spines are constantly found; I derived these from the twenty
radial spines of the common #Acanthometra#, supposing that every two
opposite spines of the latter (lying in one axis) were grown together in
the centre, whilst the intimate connection of the twenty radial spines in
the common centre was dissolved. This opinion was afterwards confirmed by
Richard Hertwig, who observed _Acanthochiasma_ intact in the living state.
Although two species of this genus are cosmopolitan and very common, the
number of species is very small; I could add to those three older known
forms only a single new species.

Another genus of this family, _Chiastolus_, was observed by me only in a
single specimen but it is extremely interesting. It has sixteen diametral
spines, disposed quite regularly after the same law of the thirty-two
spines of _Actinastrum_ which we described above (compare above, p. 729).
Therefore we cannot doubt that the former is derived from the latter in the
same way, every two opposite radial spines (of one axis) being grown
together to form a single diametral spine. As we place _Acanthometron_
(with twenty spines) and _Actinastrum_ (with thirty-two spines) in two
different families, it would perhaps be more convenient to separate also
_Acanthochiasma_ and _Chiastolus_ as representatives of two different
families--Acanthochiasmida (with ten diametral spines) and Chiastolida
(with sixteen diametral spines).

As we derive _Acanthochiasma_ from _Acanthometron_ by concrescence in pairs
of the twenty radial spines, the Müllerian law of Icosacantha must be
employed also to the ten diametral spines of the former, therefore two of
them are equatorial, four tropical, and four polar spines. In the same way
we may employ the new law of disposition found in the thirty-two radial
spines of _Actinastrum_ equally to the sixteen diametral spines of
_Chiastolus_, which we derive from the former, four of them are equatorial,
eight tropical, and four polar spines (compare above, p. 732).

_The Central Capsule_ of the Chiastolida is spherical, and exhibits in
general the same shape as in the #Acanthonida#, and specially in the
Astrolonchida. Of course every diametral spine pierces the capsule twice,
at two points diametrically opposed. In some species of _Acanthochiasma_
the central capsule is formed very late, so that it seems often to be
absent. A very accurate description of the capsule and its nucleus, as well
as of the calymma and the pseudopodia, is given by Richard Hertwig in his
Organismus der Radiolarien (1879, pp. 10-18). The pseudopodia are very
numerous, and sometimes bear reddish granules.

Genus 321. _Chiastolus_,[361] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Chiastolida# with sixteen diametral spines, derived from
thirty-two radial spines opposite and grown together in pairs.

The genus _Chiastolus_, hitherto known only by a single observed specimen,
comprises the Chiastolida with sixteen diametral spines, which are loosely
crossed in the centre of the body. Four of these spines are equatorial,
four polar, and eight tropical. We derive _Chiastolus_ from _Actinastrum_
by concrescence of every two opposite spines in one axis of the body
(compare above, pp. 729, 732).


1. _Chiastolus amphicopium_, n. sp. (Pl. 129, figs. 3, 3_a_, 3_b_).

Spines in the central part cylindrical, spirally convoluted in a very
peculiar manner, broadened towards both ends, strongly compressed,
two-edged; the broadest parts are the two truncated distal ends, five to
seven times as broad as the thinnest central part, which is placed between
two spindle-shaped intumescences. These cochleary central parts of the
sixteen spines seem to be resting one upon another. Each spine (composed of
two opposite equal radial spines) has nearly the form of a double oar. The
single observed specimen (preserved in glycerine) exhibited a most regular
disposition of the thirty-two spines (grown together in pairs in the
centre). The diameter of the dark non-transparent spherical central capsule
equalled one-fifth to one-fourth of the total length of the double spines.
When the soft parts of the body were destroyed by sulphuric acid, the
sixteen single spines were suddenly dispersed.

_Dimensions._--Length of the sixteen double spines 0.5, distal breadth (of
the truncated ends) 0.05, central breadth 0.01; diameter of the central
capsule 0.12.

_Habitat._--South-east Pacific (near Juan Fernandez), Station 297, surface.

_Definition._--#Chiastolida# with ten diametral spines, derived from twenty
radial spines opposite and grown together in pairs.

{739}The genus _Acanthochiasma_ with a small number of common species,
comprises the Chiastolida with ten diametral spines, which are loosely
crossed in the centre of the body. I could distinguish only four species,
two of which are cosmopolitan and very widely distributed. In all four
species the diametral spines are quite simple, cylindrical; only in one
species distinguished by a spiral winding or torsion in the middle part,
where they are crossed one to another. We derive _Acanthochiasma_ from
_Acanthometron_ by concrescence of every two spines opposite in one axis of
the body.

Suborder II. ACANTHONIDA, Haeckel (Pls. 130-132).

_Acanthonida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 465.

_Definition._--#Acanthometra# with twenty radial spines, disposed according
to the Müllerian or Icosacanthan law in five zones each of four spines.



Family XXXVI. #ASTROLONCHIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 130).

_Astrolonchida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 465.

_Definition._--#Acanthometra# with twenty radial spines of nearly equal
size and similar form, disposed according to the law of the Icosacantha. No
lattice-shell.

The family #Astrolonchida#, the first and oldest of the #Acanthonida#, is
no doubt the ancestral stock not only of this suborder but also all
#Acanthophracta#, _i.e._, of all Icosacantha or all ACANTHARIA in which
twenty radial spines are regularly disposed according to the Müllerian law,
forming five zones each of four alternating spines (compare above, p. 717).
The Astrolonchida differ from the #Acanthophracta# in the absence of a
complete lattice-shell, from the other two families of #Acanthonida# (the
Quadrilonchida and Amphilonchida) in the equal size and similar form of all
the spines. Probably this equality is nowhere quite perfect, since in all
Icosacantha the central bases of the twenty spines exhibit originally
certain slight differences of form and junction, effected by the regular
disposition itself. But setting aside this slight difference, only
recognisable by means of a very accurate investigation of the central
junction (and in thinner spines often not at all recognisable), the twenty
spines of the Astrolonchida appear perfectly equal. Therefore the four
equatorial spines are not distinguished from the sixteen other spines, as
is constantly the case in the two following families.

The number of genera (eleven) and of species (seventy-six) in the
Astrolonchida is far larger than in the five other families of
#Acanthometra#, and requires a distinction into three different
subfamilies. (A) In the Zygacanthida the form of the radial spines is quite
simple, without apophyses or transverse processes; (B) in the
Phractacanthida each spine bears two opposite apophyses (rarely two
longitudinal rows of these opposite apophyses); (C) in the Stauracanthida
each spine bears a cross of four apophyses, opposite in pairs (rarely four
longitudinal crossed rows of apophyses, opposite in pairs). The
Phractacanthida and Stauracanthida appear as two divergent branches of the
pedigree, derived independently from the common ancestral stock of
Zygacanthida.

In the Zygacanthida, constantly devoid of apophyses, we can distinguish
only three genera, characterised by the different fundamental form of the
radial spines; these are:--(1) _Acanthometron_, with cylindrical or conical
spines (without edges); (2) _Zygacantha_, with compressed and two-edged
spines; (3) _Acanthonia_, with four-edged, prismatic or pyramidal spines.
The transverse section of the spines is in the first case {741}circular, in
the second elliptical or lanceolate, in the third square. All the different
forms of spines, which we find in the numerous ACANTHARIA, may be reduced
to these three forms, and among these the second and third are derived from
the first.

The development of apophyses or of lateral transverse processes (wanting in
the Zygacanthida) is of the greatest value for the further differentiation
of the ACANTHARIA. For from the Phractacanthida (with two opposite
apophyses on each spine) we must derive the Phrastaspida, the common
ancestral stock of the Diporaspida (and therefore also the Belonaspida,
Hexalaspida, Diploconida, and Phractopeltida). On the other hand the
Stauracanthida (with four crossed apophyses on each spine) have produced
the Stauraspida, or the ancestral group of the Tessaraspida and
Sphærocapsida. From all these #Acanthophracta#, possessing a complete
lattice-shell, the Astrolonchida differ in the absence of such a complete
shell. Also in the few cases in which the apophyses become latticed
(_Doracantha_ among the Phractacanthida, and _Phatnacantha_ among the
Stauracanthida), the lattice-plates of the neighbouring spines never meet
with their edges, as is the case in all #Acanthophracta#. But in a
phylogenetic as well as in an ontogenetic sense the former are the
ancestral stock of the latter.

_The Central Capsule_ in the Astrolonchida is commonly spherical, sometimes
with twenty roundish elevations or conical papillæ, extending radially to
the basal half of the radial spines. The calymma is voluminous, and forms
around the radial spines conical or cylindrical "jelly-sheaths," which are
connected with the spines by coronas of Myophrisca (or of the bodies
formerly called "Gallert-cilien," afterwards recognised as "contractile
Filamente").

Genus 323. _Acanthometron_,[363] J. Müller, 1855, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.
Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 229.

_Definition._--#Astrolonchida# with simple cylindrical or needle-shaped
radial spines, without edges and without apophyses; their transverse
section is circular.

The genus _Acanthometron_, with the restricted definition here given, is
the most simple form of all #Acanthonida#, and may be regarded as the
common ancestral form not only of this suborder but also of all
#Acanthophracta#, in general of all Icosacantha, or all ACANTHARIA in which
twenty radial spines are regularly disposed after the Müllerian law (p.
717). In the wider sense, given originally to #Acanthometra# by Johannes
Müller, its discoverer, this genus comprised all ACANTHARIA constituting
here our order "#Acanthometra#" (Radiolaria without lattice-shell, with
radial spines united in the centre). In my Monograph (1862, p. 375) I
restricted this genus to those "Acanthometrida" in which twenty simple
spines of equal size (and without apophyses) are supported one upon another
in the centre, and I separated as _Astrolithium_ those forms in which they
are grown together in the centre. But this difference now appears not so
important, and I restrict here the genus _Acanthometron_ (not
#Acanthometra#) to those most simple forms in which the simple radial
spines are cylindrical or conical, without edges.

Wiss. Berlin, p. 51.

_Definition._--#Astrolonchida# with simple, compressed, and two-edged
radial spines, without apophyses; their transverse section is elliptical or
rhomboidal.

The genus _Zygacantha_ comprised in the original definition of J. Müller
only a single species, _Zygacantha furcata_, distinguished from the other
#Acanthometra# by forked spines with two long parallel teeth. It seems now
advisable to unite in this genus all those Astrolonchida in which the
simple spines are two-edged, compressed, or leaf-shaped. The term
_Zygacantha_ may be conceived as the general expression of the important
fact, that in all Icosacantha the twenty spines are opposite in pairs.

{749}Genus 325. _Acanthonia_,[365] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 465.

_Definition._--#Astrolonchida# with simple, four-edged, prismatic or
pyramidal radial spines, without apophyses; their transverse section is
square.

The genus _Acanthonia_ comprises all those Astrolonchida (formerly united
with _Acanthometron_) in which the simple spines either in their whole
length or in the greatest part of it are four-edged, with square transverse
section. They are sometimes more prismatic (with equal breadth), at other
times more pyramidal (with decreasing breadth towards the distal apex). If
_Acanthometron_ be the common simple ancestral form of the Acanthonida,
then the two-edged _Zygacantha_, and the four-edged _Acanthonia_ may be
regarded as two divergent main lines arising from it; the former leading to
the Phractacanthida and Diporaspida, the latter leading to the
Stauracanthida and Tessaraspida.

octahedron; the basal leaf-cross being extremely developed, with four very
large and thin lamellar leaves; the basal halves of the twenty double

_Definition._--#Astrolonchida# with two simple, not branched, opposite
apophyses on each radial spine.

The genus _Lithophyllium_ was founded by J. Müller for a single species
(_Lithophyllium foliosum_), which we also here retain as the type of the
genus. It is the first observed Astrolonchid, which bears two opposite
lateral apophyses on each spine, and may therefore be regarded as the
ancestral form of the subfamily Phractacanthida. The two opposite apophyses
are here simple, whilst in the other genera of the subfamily they are
branched or multiplied.

Spines lanceolate, tapering from the broader middle towards the two ends.
From the middle part or from the outer third arise two opposite triangular
apophyses, which are not perpendicular to the axis of the spine, but form
an acute angle with its distal part. Therefore each spine represents a
broad leaf with a middle rib and with three lobes or truncated teeth. The
distal apex is distinguished by a violet colour. Base pyramidal, without
leaf-cross. Central capsule yellow.

{755}Genus 327. _Phractacantha_,[367] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 465.

_Definition_.--#Astrolonchida# with two branched, but not latticed,
opposite apophyses on each radial spine.

The genus _Phractacantha_ differs from its ancestral form, the preceding
_Lithophyllium_ by the ramification of the apophyses, which are either
forked or bear lateral branches. If the prolonged fork-branches of the
neighbouring spines meet and form a lattice-shell, this genus passes over
into _Phractaspis_, the common ancestral form of the Diporaspida.


1. _Phractacantha_ bifurca, n. sp.

Spines cylindrical, thin, of equal breadth throughout their whole length.
Apex simple. Base pyramidal, without leaf-cross. From the outer third arise
two opposite, thin, forked apophyses; ends of the fork branches acute.

_Dimensions._--Length of the spines 0.1, breadth 0.006.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 274, surface.


2. _Phractacantha bipennis_, n. sp.

Spines compressed, two-edged, tapering from the broader middle towards the
two ends. Apex simple. Base pyramidal, without leaf-cross. From the middle
arise two opposite broad, forked apophyses; ends of the fork-branches broad
and obtuse.

_Dimensions._--Length of the spines 0.15, breadth in the middle 0.012.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 266, surface.



Genus 328. _Doracantha_,[368] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 465.

_Definition_.--#Astrolonchida# with two latticed or fenestrated apophyses
on each radial spine.

The genus _Doracantha_ arises from the foregoing _Phractacantha_ by union
of the fork-branches of the apophyses on each spine. By this concrescence
is formed a polygonal or roundish plate with two pores, pierced by the
radial spine between them. _Doracantha_ may be regarded as a _Dorataspis_,
in which the twenty small fenestrated plates have not become united.


{756}1. _Doracantha dorataspis_, n. sp.

Spines compressed, two-edged, tapering from the broader middle towards the
two ends. Apex simple. Base pyramidal, without leaf-cross. From the middle
part of each spine arise two opposite forked apophyses; the neighbouring
fork-branches are recurved and united in the tangential plane; so that each
spine bears a plate or shield with two elliptical pores; the margin of the
roundish plate bears a variable number of short teeth.

_Dimensions._--Length of the spines 0.2, breadth 0.02.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.



Genus 329. _Astrolonche_,[369] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 465.

_Definition._--#Astrolonchida# with numerous simple apophyses (four to
eight or more on each radial spine), which are arranged in two opposite
longitudinal rows (rarely in six such rows, opposite in three parallel
planes).

The genus _Astrolonche_ differs from the preceding Phractacanthida in the
multiplication of the simple apophyses. Commonly these are opposite in
pairs in two longitudinal rows (on the two edges of the compressed spine,
at least two on each side). But sometimes (in the subgenus
_Astrolonchidium_) there are six instead of two longitudinal rows of teeth,
and these are placed in three parallel planes.



Subgenus 1. _Astroloncharium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Each spine with two longitudinal rows of apophyses, opposite
in one meridian plane.


1. _Astrolonche bicruciata_, n. sp.

Spines compressed, two-edged, almost of equal breadth throughout their
whole length, with simple apex and small leaf-cross at the base. From the
two edges of the  middle part of each spine arise two pairs of opposite
apophyses, which are compressed and a little curved (convex on the distal,
concave on the proximal margin). All four apophyses are of the same size
and form; the radial distance of each pair much smaller than their common
distance from the centre.

  _Aspidomma mucronatum_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 424.

Spines conical, little compressed, with simple apex and small leaf-cross at
the base. From the basal half of each spine arise two pairs of opposite
apophyses, which exhibit a very different form. {757}The upper or distal
apophyses (nearly in the middle of the spine) are flat, leaf-shaped,
broadened in the periphery, often lobed, and sometimes branched or even
fenestrated. (Transition to _Phractaspis_ and _Dorataspis_, or to
_Phractopelta_?) The lower or proximal apophyses are thick, simple, all
slightly curved; they are equidistant from the former and from the centre.

Spines in the distal half compressed, linear, two-edged, with bifid apex;
in the proximal half three times as broad lanceolate, at the base
pyramidal, without leaf-cross. From the two broader edges of the proximal
half arise two longitudinal rows of opposite apophyses; four to six broad
triangular teeth in each row.

  _Acanthometra serrata_, Haeckel, 1860, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 807.

Spines in the distal half thin, nearly cylindrical or a little compressed,
thinned towards the short simple or bifid apex; in the proximal half three
to six times as broad, four-winged, with six longitudinal rows of opposite
apophyses. From the edges of the two broader (lateral) wings arise three
{758}to four pairs of strong conical teeth; from the edges of the two
smaller (sagittal) wings arise also three to four pairs of teeth, but very
short and broad, triangular; each of these teeth bears on both its
(lateral) sides two opposite slender conical teeth, which are parallel to
the large conical teeth of the lateral wings. Therefore all teeth (eighteen
to twenty-four) are placed opposite in pairs in three parallel planes. Base
of the spines pyramidal, with a small leaf-cross. The central capsule of
this large and  very remarkable species commonly entirely includes the
apophyses of the spines, and is opaque, whitish.

Genus 330. _Xiphacantha_,[370] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 384.

_Definition._--#Astrolonchida# with four simple apophyses on each radial
spine, opposite in pairs in the form of a cross.

The genus _Xiphacantha_ was founded by me in 1862 for all those
_Acanthometrida_ which bear simple or branched apophyses on their twenty
equal spines. I restrict here the genus to those Astrolonchida which bear
on each spine a cross of four simple, not branched, apophyses. These are
either conical teeth or broad wings, sometimes extremely thin leaves.
_Xiphacantha_ may be regarded as the ancestral form not only of the
subfamily Stauracanthida, but also of the Tessaraspida, derived from the
latter.

simply forked at the end. Each apophysis with two short straight fork
branches.

(without leaf-cross); with four slender apophyses, which are doubly forked
about in their middle. Each apophysis with four short and thin terminal
branches.

_Dimensions._--Length of the spines 0.2, breadth 0.002; distance of the

Genus 332. _Phatnacantha_,[372] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 465.

_Definition._--#Astrolonchida# with four apophyses on each radial spine,
opposite in pairs in cross form, and forming a lattice-plate by
communicating branches.

The genus _Phatnacantha_ has been derived from the preceding _Stauracantha_
by concrescence of the branches of the apophyses. Therefore each spine
bears a lattice-plate or a fenestrated shield. If the growing plates of the
neighbouring spines {765}meet together, then the characteristic
lattice-shell of the Tessaraspida is perfect. Either each plate bears four
crossed pores (like _Tessaraspis_), or a larger number of pores (four
aspinal and four to eight or more coronal) like _Icosaspis_.


1. _Phatnacantha tessaraspis_, n. sp.

Spines quadrangular prismatic, with simple pyramidal apex and small basal
leaf-cross. Each spine bears in the basal half a square plate, which is
perforated by four square pores; margin of the plate with twelve short
straight teeth.

_Dimensions._--Length of the spines 0.12, breadth 0.005.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 265, surface.


2. _Phatnacantha icosaspis_, n. sp. (Pl. 130, fig. 6).

Spines quadrangular with prominent edges; prismatic in the basal half, with
a broad basal leaf-cross, pyramidal in the distal half, with a simple or
truncate apex. Each spine bears in the middle part a square plate, which is
perforated by eight to sixteen or more square pores (four aspinal and four
to eight or more coronal); margin of the plate with twenty-four to
forty-eight or more short straight irregular compressed teeth.

_Dimensions._--Length of the spines 0.18, breadth 0.008.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 273, surface.



Genus 333. _Pristacantha_,[373] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Astrolonchida# with numerous simple apophyses (eight to
sixteen or more on each radial spine) which are arranged in four
longitudinal rows opposite in pairs in the form of a cross.

The genus _Pristacantha_ differs from all other Stauracanthida in the
multiplication of the crossed apophyses (at least eight on each spine), and
exhibits therefore to them the same relation as _Astrolonche_ exhibits to
the other Phractacanthida. The remarkable _Astrolonchidium serratum_
appears intermediate between both groups.


1. _Pristacantha octodon_, n. sp. (Pl. 130, fig. 9).

Spines four-sided prismatic, a little broader in the middle part than at
either end, with thin prominent edges. Apex truncate or pyramidal. Base
pyramidal, with a small leaf-cross. From the four edges arise in the basal
half (between first and second third of the length) eight slender, conical,
or triangular apophyses (two on each edge).

_Dimensions._--Length of the spines 0.4 to 0.6, breadth 0.02 to 0.04.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.


{766}2. _Pristacantha dodecodon_, n. sp. (Pl. 130, fig. 8).

Spines four-winged, of lanceolate outline, tapering from the broader middle
towards the two ends. Apex pyramidal.  Base with a large leaf-cross.  From
the four wings arise in the basal part (between first and second third of
the length) twelve triangular apophyses (three from each wing).

_Dimensions._--Length of the spines 0.3, breadth in the middle 0.03.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 244, surface.


3. _Pristacantha polyodon_, n. sp. (Pl. 130, fig. 7).

Spines in the distal half four-sided prismatic, thin, with pyramidal apex;
in the basal half much broader, four-winged, with a large leaf-cross on the
base. From the four wings of the basal half arises a variable number of
slender teeth or triangular apophyses, commonly sixteen to twenty-four,
often irregular (four to six from each wing).

_Dimensions._--Length of the spines 0.3 to 0.4, breadth in the distal part
0.007 to 0.01, in the basal part 0.02 to 0.03.

_Habitat._--South Pacific (off New Zealand), Station 169, surface.



Family XXXVII. #QUADRILONCHIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 131).

_Acanthostaurida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 466.

_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with twenty radial spines of very unequal size,
disposed according to the law of the Icosacantha; four equatorial spines
much larger than the sixteen others. No lattice-shell.

The family #Quadrilonchida# differs from the foregoing ancestral family,
the Astrolonchida, in the unequal development of the twenty radial spines.
The four equatorial spines are constantly much larger, and often also of
another form and shape, than the sixteen other spines; often also among
these the eight tropical spines are larger and of another form than the
eight polar spines. Therefore the five parallel girdles or zones of every
four spines, which in the Astrolonchida are equal, are here distinctly
unequal. The whole body is flattened and compressed in the direction of the
spineless axis, so that the equatorial plane is larger than any other
plane, laid through the centre. In consequence of this flattening the
central capsule is also commonly compressed and flattened, lenticular or
discoidal, rarely spherical. In the Astrolonchida the "promorph" or the
"geometrical fundamental form" is constantly a square double pyramid, the
axes of which are of equal length.  In the Quadrilonchida it becomes a
square double pyramid, the two equatorial axes of which (or the diagonals
of the square) are constantly longer than all other axes.

In the simpler forms of Quadrilonchida are found only two different kinds
of spines, the four larger equatorial spines being of the same size and
form, and the sixteen smaller {767}spines also not differing from one
another (_Acanthostaurus_, &c.).  But in the majority of this family there
are three different kinds: four larger equatorial spines, eight tropical
spines of middle size, and eight smaller polar spines (_Belonostaurus_,
&c.); the latter become sometimes rudimentary, so that only twelve spines
are developed (four larger equatorial and eight smaller tropical spines).
In this case the development of the flat discoidal body is much stronger in
the equatorial plane than in all other planes. These discoidal or
lenticular Quadrilonchida exhibit a relation to the spherical Astrolonchida
similar to that which the #Discoidea# exhibit to the #Sphæroidea# among the
#Sphærellaria#.

A further morphological differentation takes place in the remarkable genera
_Lonchostaurus_ and _Zygostaurus_. In the former (Pl. 131, figs. 4-6) the
four larger equatorial spines becomes differentiated in pairs, so that the
opposite equal spines of one pair, _c_1, _c_3 (in the longitudinal or
hydrotomical axis), are larger, and often also of another form, than the
opposite equal spines of the other pair, _c_2, _c_4 (in the transverse or
geotomical axis). The most peculiar form is the rather common _Zygostaurus_
(Pl. 131, figs. 7, 8). Here the two opposite spines of one equatorial axis
(of the longitudinal axis) become very different, so that the anterior or
frontal spine (_c_1) is very unequal to the posterior or caudal spine
(_c_3), whereas the two opposite spines, of the other equatorial axis (of
the transverse axis) remain equal (_c_2, _c_4). Therefore the fundamental
forms become here "amphithect," as in the Ctenophora.

The numerous Quadrilonchida may be disposed in two different subfamilies:
in the Acanthostaurida all twenty radial spines are simple, without
apophyses; in the Lithopterida all twenty spines (or  only one part of
them) bear two opposite apophyses (or lateral transverse processes). The
former correspond to the Zygacanthida, the latter to the Phractacanthida
among the Astrolonchida. The two opposite apophyses are simple in
_Quadrilonche_ (Pl. 133, fig. 1). In _Xiphoptera_ they are provided on
their distal side with lateral branches which are parallel to the spine
itself. In _Lithoptera_ the spines bear two to four parallel pairs of
transverse apophyses, and these are crossed by perpendicular branches,
parallel to the spine itself, so that there arise fenestrated wings or
latticed plates, comparable to the sails of a wind-mill. The lattice-work
of these plates lies in the same meridian plane with the radial spine
itself, and is therefore not comparable to the fenestrated apophyses of
_Doracantha_, of _Phatnacantha_, and of the Dorataspida; in these the
lattice-plates lie in tangential planes, perpendicular to the radial spine.

The apophyses of the Lithopterida may be developed either on all twenty
spines equally, or only on twelve spines (four equatorial and eight
tropical, whilst the eight polar spines are simple, Pl. 131, fig. 10), or
only on the four equatorial spines (whilst the sixteen others are simple,
Pl. 131, fig. 9).

_The Central Capsule_ of the Quadrilonchida is rarely spherical, commonly
more or {768}less compressed from both poles of the spineless axis,
lenticular or discoidal, sometimes square. It is enveloped by a voluminous
calymma constantly bearing coronals of "Myophrisca" (compare p. 724).

The genus _Acanthostaurus_ is the most simple and primitive form of the
Quadrilonchida, and the common ancestral genus of this family; it is at the
same time its most common and widely distributed form. Some species appear
in astonishing numbers in different seas. It has been derived from
_Acanthometron_ by stronger development of the four equatorial spines,
which are all of equal size and much larger than the sixteen others.

Genus 335. _Belonostaurus_,[375] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Quadrilonchida# with four equatorial spines of equal size
and form, which are much larger than the sixteen other spines. Eight
tropical and eight polar spines very different. No apophyses.

The genus _Belonostaurus_ differs from the preceding _Acanthostaurus_ in
the unequal size and form of the eight tropical and the eight polar spines;
the latter are much smaller than the former and often quite rudimentary, so
that the skeleton appears composed only of twelve spines, four larger
equatorial and eight smaller tropical spines. The central bases of the
polar spines are constantly preserved. The central capsule is a flattened
square disk.


1. _Belonostaurus quadratus_, n. sp.

Four equatorial spines little compressed, almost cylindrical in the basal
half, lanceolate, broader, with simple apex in the distal half. Eight
tropical spines a little shorter, but only half as broad,
{772}sword-shaped, two-edged, of equal breadth, with simple apex. Eight
polar spines very short, conical, also with simple apex. Base without
leaf-cross, a simple pyramid.

_Dimensions._--Length of the four equatorial spines 0.18, of the eight
tropical spines 0.14, of the eight polar spines 0.04.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.


2. _Belonostaurus bicuspis_, n. sp.

Four equatorial spines compressed, almost lanceolate in the basal half,
bifid, with two large, bent, little divergent horns in the distal half.
Eight tropical spines nearly of the same form, but only half as large, with
much smaller horns. Eight polar spines rudimentary, very short, conical,
with simple apex. Base with a large leaf-cross.

_Dimensions._--Length of the four equatorial spines 0.2, of the eight
tropical spines 0.1, of the eight polar spines 0.02.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 263, surface.



Genus 336. _Lonchostaurus_,[376] Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 397
(_sensu emendato_).

_Definition._--#Quadrilonchida# with four equatorial spines of unequal size
and form; the principal spines (in the longitudinal axis) larger than the
lateral spines (in the transverse axis); both opposite spines of each pair
equal. Sixteen other spines much smaller (often the eight tropical larger
than the eight rudimentary polar spines). No apophyses.

The genus _Lonchostaurus_ differs from the two preceding genera in the
unequal size and shape of both equatorial pairs of spines, whilst the two
opposite spines of each pair are equal. Therefore the equatorial plane is
here a rhombus, not a square, as in the preceding genera. We encounter here
for the first time the differentiation of the two equatorial axes, the
longitudinal (or hydrotomical) and the transverse (or geotomical) axis. The
sixteen other spines are constantly smaller (often also the eight polar
more or less rudimentary).


1. _Lonchostaurus rhomboides_, n. sp. (Pl. 131, fig. 6).

Four equatorial spines cylindrical, twice to three times as broad as the
sixteen smaller spines, conical at the distal apex; the two opposite spines
of the longitudinal axis twice as long as those of the transverse axis.
Sixteen smaller spines conical at the base, with simple bristle-shaped
apex. The surface of the rhombical calymma, including the spines, was
covered in the figured specimen with small plates like those of
_Sphærocapsa_.

_Dimensions._--Length of the cross (longitudinal axis) 0.24, breadth
(transverse axis) 0.12.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 302, depth 1450 fathoms.


{773}2. _Lonchostaurus lanceolatus_, n. sp.

Four equatorial spines compressed, lanceolate, tapering equally from the
middle towards the two ends; the two opposite spines of the longitudinal
axis one and a half times as long as those of the transverse axis. Sixteen
smaller spines compressed, linear, two-edged, half as long and only
one-fourth as broad as the two longitudinal spines.

_Dimensions._--Length of the equatorial cross 0.3, breadth 0.2.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 272, surface.


3. _Lonchostaurus bifidus_, n. sp.

Four equatorial spines compressed, nearly rectangular, forked, with two
long and thin, bent, little divergent horns; the two opposite spines of the
longitudinal axis about one-third longer and broader than those of the
transverse axis. Sixteen smaller spines of the same form, also forked, but
the eight tropical only half as large, and the eight polar spines scarcely
one-fourth as large as the two longitudinal spines.

_Dimensions._--Length of the equatorial cross 0.36, breadth 0.26.

_Habitat._--South-west Pacific, Station 166, surface.


4. _Lonchostaurus bifurcus_, n. sp. (Pl. 131, fig. 4).

Four equatorial spines nearly rhomboidal, about one and a half times as
large as the eight tropical and three times as large as the eight polar
spines; the two opposite spines of the longitudinal axis only with two
large divergent straight horns; the two spines of the transverse axis
somewhat shorter, with four short horns (the two outer horns longer than
the two inner). Eight tropical spines doubly forked, each with four thin
bristle-shaped horns. Eight polar spines very short, each with two thin
bristle-shaped, much divergent horns.

_Dimensions._--Length of the equatorial cross 0.34, breadth 0.28.

_Habitat._--North-west Pacific, Station 236, surface.


5. _Lonchostaurus rhombicus_, n. sp.

Four equatorial spines nearly rhomboidal, tapering from the broader middle
towards the two ends. Leaf-cross of their base very large. The two opposite
spines of the longitudinal axis about one-third larger than the two spines
of the transverse axis. Eight tropical spines of the same form, but only
half as large. Eight polar spines rudimentary, very short, conical.

_Dimensions._--Length of the equatorial cross 0.4, breadth 0.3.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 253, surface.


6. _Lonchostaurus crystallinus_, n. sp. (Pl. 131, fig. 5).

Four equatorial spines lanceolate or rhomboidal, with broad leaf-cross at
the base, of a peculiar crystalline structure and a lamellated surface,
both opposite spines of the longitudinal axis twice as {774}large as the
two spines of the transverse axis. Eight tropical spines of similar form,

Genus 337. _Zygostaurus_,[377] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Quadrilonchida# with four equatorial spines of unequal size
and form; both lateral spines (in the transverse axis) equal; but both
principal spines (in the longitudinal axis) very different, the frontal
larger than the caudal. Sixteen other spines much smaller (often the eight
tropical larger than the eight rudimentary polar spines). No apophyses.

The genus _Zygostaurus_ differs from all other Staurolonchida in the
peculiar differentiation of the four equatorial spines; the two opposite
spines of the hydrotomical or longitudinal axis being very different in
size and form (the frontal spine forked, the caudal spine simple); whilst
the two opposite spines of the geotomical or lateral axis (perpendicular to
the former) are equal, forked, but different in shape from the former.
Therefore the geometrical fundamental form of the body in this remarkable
genus becomes "amphithect" or "bilateral" in the widest signification of
this term (comp. my General Morphology, vol. i. pp. 480, 482). Of the three
different dimensive axes one (the longitudinal) exhibits unequal poles,
whilst the two other (the sagittal and lateral) axes exhibit equal poles.

Subfamily 2. LITHOPTERIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Quadrilonchida# with two opposite transverse apophyses
either on all twenty spines or only on a part of them.



Genus 338. _Quadrilonche_,[378] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Quadrilonchida# with two simple opposite apophyses either
on each radial spine or only on a part of the twenty spines.

The genus _Quadrilonche_ is the ancestral form of the Lithopterida, or of
those Quadrilonchida which bear two opposite apophyses or transverse
processes. In _Quadrilonche_ these apophyses are simple, whilst they are
branched in _Xiphoptera_ and fenestrated in _Lithoptera_. Each of these
three genera may be divided into three subgenera; in the first only the
four equatorial spines are provided with apophyses, in the second twelve
spines (four equatorial and eight tropical), in the third subgenus all
twenty spines.



Subgenus 1. _Quadriloncharium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Four large equatorial spines provided with transverse
apophyses; sixteen other smaller spines simple, without apophyses.


1. _Quadrilonche tetrastaura_, n. sp.

Four equatorial spines very large, compressed, two-edged, each crossed in
the distal third by two opposite simple apophyses. Sixteen other spines

{777}2. _Quadrilonche platystaura_, n. sp. (Pl. 131, fig. 2).

Four equatorial spines lanceolate, compressed, with two opposite triangular
simple apophyses in the broadest middle part. Sixteen other spines also
lanceolate, much smaller, of about half the length, but only of one-fourth
the breadth, without apophyses.

_Dimensions._--Length of the four major spines 0.2, breadth 0.018; length
of the sixteen minor spines 0.1, breadth 0.004.

3. _Quadrilonche mesostaura_, n. sp. (Pl. 131, fig. 1).

Four equatorial spines almost of the some form and length as the sixteen
others, but of double or triple the breadth; each spine in its middle third
with two opposite broad triangular apophyses, in the basal third
rectangular, compressed, in the distal third isosceles triangular, with
simple apex.

Four equatorial spines one and a half times as long and three times as
broad as the sixteen others; all twenty spines cylindrical, of equal
breadth throughout their whole length, with simple conical apex; each spine
crossed in the distal third by two opposite, simple, conical apophyses.

_Dimensions._--Length of the four major spines 0.3, breadth 0.012; length
of the sixteen minor spines 0.2, breadth 0.004.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic, Station 325, surface.



Genus 339. _Xiphoptera_,[379] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 466.

_Definition._--#Quadrilonchida# with two opposite branched (but not
latticed) apophyses, either on each radial spine or only on a part of the
twenty spines.

The genus _Xiphoptera_ differs from the preceding ancestral genus
_Quadrilonche_ in the ramification of the apophyses, which bear
perpendicular branches on their distal side. These are therefore parallel
to the spine itself. If the branches become united by transverse beams then
we get _Lithoptera_.

Four equatorial spines in the outer third crossed by two opposite
transverse apophyses, each of which bears on its distal side two to three

opposite transverse apophyses.

_Dimensions._--Length of the four major spines 0.18, of the sixteen minor
0.05 to 0.1.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 238, surface.


2. _Xiphoptera dodecactena_, n. sp. (Pl. 131, fig. 3).

Four equatorial spines one and a half times to twice as long and broad as
the eight tropical spines. These twelve spines have the same form and are
crossed in their distal third by two large opposite transverse apophyses,
each of which bears on its distal side two to four branches, perpendicular
to the apophysis and parallel to the spine. Eight polar spines much smaller
than the twelve others, simple, without apophyses. The central capsule of
this species exhibited a conical protuberance around the base of each
individual spine.

_Dimensions._--Length of the twelve larger spines 0.1 to 0.2, of the eight
smaller 0.02 to 0.06.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 272, surface.


3. _Xiphoptera icosactena_, n. sp.

Four equatorial spines about twice as long and four times as broad as the
sixteen other spines. All twenty spines crossed in the outer third by two
large opposite transverse apophyses, each of which bears on its distal side
two to four branches perpendicular to the apophysis and parallel to the
spine itself.

_Dimensions._--Length of the four equatorial spines 0.26, of the sixteen
smaller 0.11 to 0.14.

Genus 340. _Lithoptera_,[380] J. Müller, 1858, Monatsber. d. k. preuss.
Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 155.

_Definition._--#Quadrilonchida# with two opposite branched and latticed
apophyses, either on each radial spine or only on a part of the twenty
spines.

The genus _Lithoptera_, founded by Johannes Müller in 1858 for the first
observed Mediterranean species, _Lithoptera fenestrata_, differs from all
other Quadrilonchida in the fenestrated form of the apophyses, which he
compared to the sails of a windmill. This peculiar fenestration is effected
by two to four parallel pairs of opposite apophyses, which are crossed by
perpendicular branches, parallel to the spine itself. {779}Therefore the
wings or lattice-plates have quadrangular meshes and lie in one meridian
plane of the spine, not in a tangential plane (as in the _Acanthophracta_).
Commonly the lateral ends of the four broad equatorial wings are so crossed
that one lateral corner of each wing lies on the upper, the other corner on
the under side of both its neighbours; but sometimes the meeting corners
have grown together.

perfectly in the equatorial plane, but a little obliquely, so that each
wing lies with one lateral corner on the upper, with the other corner on
the under side of its neighbours. Sixteen smaller spines simple, thin,
cylindrical, without apophyses.

Family XXXVIII. #AMPHILONCHIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 132).

_Acantholonchida_ (Amphilonchida et Amphilithida), Haeckel, 1881,
Prodromus, p. 466.

_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with twenty radial spines of very unequal size,
disposed according to the law of the Icosacantha; two opposite equatorial
spines (in the longitudinal axis) much larger than the eighteen others. No
lattice-shell.

The family #Amphilonchida# is distinguished from all other #Acanthometra#
by the excessive development of two opposite equatorial spines, which are
much larger {782}than the eighteen other spines. In my Monograph (1862, p.
389) I had united all these Acanthonida in a single genus _Amphilonche_
(with ten species). Some species of it are very common and widely
distributed; but in general the number of different forms in this family is
much smaller than in the two foregoing families.

The two principal spines, which in all Amphilonchida are much larger than
the eighteen other spines, characterise the "hydrotomical axis" or the
larger equatorial axis. The two other equatorial spines or the "geotomical
spines" are much smaller, and commonly of the same size as the eight
tropical and the eight polar spines. In the genera _Amphilonche_ and
_Amphibelone_ these eighteen smaller spines are rather equally developed;
sometimes they are very small or quite rudimentary, so that the skeleton
seems to be represented only by the two very long principal spines (Pl.
132, fig. 4). The genus _Acantholonche_ is distinguished by the unequal
size of the eight tropical and the eight polar spines, the latter being
more or less rudimentary. However, the central bases of all twenty spines,
by which they are united in the centre, are constantly present. The genus
_Amphibelone_ is distinguished by the unequal size and form of the two
principal spines, one of them the "caudal spine," being larger (and often
of another form) than the opposite "frontal spine."

The form of the radial spines is in the Amphilonchida far less varied and
complicated than in the other Acanthonida (the Astrolonchida and
Quadrilonchida). Apophyses or lateral transverse processes are never
developed. The three main forms of spines are the same as in the other
Acanthonida; they are (1) either cylindrical or conical (like
_Acanthometron_), or (2) compressed or two-edged (like _Zygacantha_), or
(3) quadrangular or four-edged (like _Acanthonia_). Often the spines are
angular in the inner or proximal, roundish in the outer or distal part. The
distal apex is commonly simple, conical or pyramidal. The central base is
commonly also pyramidal, as in the majority of the Acanthonida; and the
triangular faces of the neighbouring bases are simply propped one upon
another. More rarely a basal leaf-cross is developed above the basal
pyramid. Very rarely the central bases of the united spines grow together
in the centre, so that the whole skeleton forms a single piece of acanthin.

_The Central Capsule_ is rarely spherical, commonly prolonged in the
direction of the hydrotomical axis; ellipsoidal or cylindrical, sometimes
also four-sided prismatic; it commonly envelops the greater part of the two
principal spines; its structure and contents are the same as in the other
Acanthonida.

    Prodromus, p. 467.

_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with complete latticed shell.

The order #Acanthophracta#, the fourth order of Radiolaria, comprises all
those ACANTHARIA in which the acanthinic skeleton is a complete latticed or
fenestrated shell, supported by radial spines arising from one common
central point. By the possession of such a complete shell the
#Acanthophracta# differ from their ancestral group, the nearly allied
#Acanthometra#, which represent the older and simpler, first order of
ACANTHARIA. All #Acanthophracta# are Icosacantha (like the #Acanthonida#,
their ancestral group), and possess twenty radial spines disposed according
to the Müllerian law (compare above, p. 717).

Johannes Müller, who first observed five representatives of this order,
called a part of them "_Acanthometræ cataphractæ_," and united these with
the true #Acanthometra# (_Acanthometra costata_ and _Acanthometra
cataphracta_; Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, 1858, pp. 12, 49).
Another part was united by him with the true _Haliomma_ (_Haliomma
echinoides_, _Haliomma hystrix_, _Haliomma tabulatum_; Abhandl. d. k. Akad.
d. Wiss. Berlin, 1858, pp. 36, 37). He supposed that these latter formed
the immediate transition from the true #Acanthometra# to the true
_Haliomma_, and that their skeleton was siliceous.

{792}In my Monograph (1862, p. 412) I founded a separate subfamily,
Dorataspida, for the "_Acanthometræ cataphractæ,_" which I considered as
the first subfamily of the "Ommatida." That subfamily contained at that
time only two genera, _Dorataspis_ (with seven species) and
_Haliommatidium_ (with five species). A third genus, _Aspidomma_ (with two
species), was united by me with the Haliommatida (because of its double
shell). For a fourth genus (_Diploconus_) with a single species I founded
the peculiar family of Diploconida. Therefore the whole number of
#Acanthophracta# described in my Monograph amounted only to four genera and
fifteen species. Now the rich collections of the Challenger have added such
a great number of new forms, that we may distinguish here thirty-eight
genera and two hundred and twelve species.

Richard Hertwig in his excellent work (Der Organismus der Radiolarien,
1879, p. 25) separated his "Acanthophractida" perfectly from the "Ommatida"
(or the siliceous #Sphæroidea#), and united them with the "Acanthometrida"
in his order "Acanthometrea." But he separated them also from the nearly
allied Diploconida, following my former arrangement. He distinctly noted
that the skeleton in all these Acanthophractida (as well as in the
Acanthometrida) consists not of silex but of the organic substance
"acanthin."

The astonishing number of new and interesting forms of #Acanthophracta#
which I have found in the rich collection of the Challenger enables me to
distinguish now in this suborder six different families, two of which are
perfectly new (the Sphærocapsida and the Hexalaspida). But the four other
families also are so much enlarged that their interesting morphology
appears in quite a new and clear light. Far the largest and most important
of these six families is that of the true Dorataspida, which embraces
seventeen genera and one hundred and eight species (more than the other
five families together). From this largest and oldest ancestral family four
other families have afterwards arisen, whilst a single family, the
Sphærocapsida, seems to possess no direct phylogenetic connection with the
five other families.

The peculiar and quite new family of Sphærocapsida (Pl. 133, figs. 7-11;
Pl. 135, figs. 6-10) differs from all other #Acanthophracta# in the
singular structure of the spherical acanthinic shell, composed of
innumerable small plates or aglets, each of which is pierced by a very
small porule. This peculiar pavemented shell (enclosing the central capsule
and separated from it by the jelly-like calymma) seems to be produced on
the surface of the spherical calymma, immediately by secretion of the
pseudopodia, and independently from the twenty radial spines, united in the
centre of the sphere. On the twenty points, where the spines perforate the
shell, there are originally eighty larger pores (four around each piercing
spine); but there is no certain indication that the shell is produced by
the meeting apophyses of the twenty spines, as is the case in the five
other families of #Acanthophracta#. Therefore perhaps it is {793}more
natural to unite these latter into another suborder as #Cladophracta#, and
to separate them from the Sphærocapsida, which may be called Capsophractæ.

The Dorataspida (Pls. 134-138), the common ancestral stock of the
#Cladophracta#, in the definition here restricted embraces all those
#Acanthophracta# in which the spherical lattice-shell is simple and
composed of the meeting branches of twenty radial spines united in its
centre. As already pointed out above, this family is probably diphyletic,
and embraces two subfamilies which have been derived originally from two
different forms of #Acanthonida#--the Diporaspida (with two opposite
apophyses on each spine) derived from the Phractacanthida, and the
Tessaraspida (with four crossed apophyses on each spine) derived from the
Stauracanthida; in the former we find originally forty apophyses, in the
latter eighty apophyses, by the meeting branches of which the spherical
lattice-shell originates. The four following families of #Acanthophracta#
have probably been derived from the Diporaspida.

The Phractopeltida (Pl. 133, figs. 1-6) differ from all other
#Acanthophracta# in the possession of a double lattice-shell, composed of
two concentric spheres which are united by the twenty radial spines meeting
in the centre. As all Phractopeltida possess originally only two apophyses
on each radial spine, they must be derived from the Diporaspida
(_Orophaspis_), and bear to them the same relation as the Dyosphærida do to
the Monosphærida. As the spherical central capsule of the Phractopeltida is
enclosed between both shells, smaller than the outer, larger than the inner
shell, the latter may be called "medullary shell," the former "cortical
shell." This family represents among the #Acanthophracta# only the
"Diplophracta," whilst all others are "Haplophracta."

The three families here characterised may be called together
"#Sphærophracta#," as their central capsule and the enveloping shell are
constantly spherical (or the shell sometimes an "endospherical
polyhedron"). On the contrary the following three families of
#Acanthophracta# may be united as "#Prunophracta#," as their central
capsule and shell are never spherical, but either ellipsoidal or lenticular
or of another form. The common ancestral stock of this suborder are the
Belonaspida, in which the form of the central capsule and the enclosing
lattice-shell is ellipsoidal; they are derived from the Dorataspida (and
probably all from the subfamily Diporaspida) by the prolongation of two
opposite radial spines which are larger than the eighteen others; they are
the two equatorial spines of the "hydrotomical axis" (compare above, p.
719, and Pl. 136, figs. 6-9).

The Hexalaspida (Pl. 139) represent a new and very remarkable family,
distinguished from all other #Acanthophracta# by the preponderating
development of six stout radial spines, which are much larger than the
fourteen others. These six principal spines lie in one meridian plane of
the shell (in the "hydrotomical plane," p. 720), and are the two opposite
equatorial spines and the four appertaining polar spines of the same plane.
{794}As the fourteen smaller spines develop their apophyses at smaller
distances from the centre, the shell assumes a peculiar lenticular or
discoidal form, and the margin of this disk bears the six larger spines.
Moreover the enclosed small central capsule is lenticular. The Hexalaspida
may be derived immediately from the Belonaspida.

The Diploconida (Pl. 140) form the last and the most modified family of all
#Acanthophracta#. The remarkable shell exhibits the strange form of a
double cone, bearing in its axis two very large opposite spines; these are
the two equatorial spines of the "hydrotomical axis" (p. 719). The
double-conical or nearly cylindrical shell is composed of three different
parts or segments; the small middle part is the true lattice-shell of the
Hexalaspida and Belonaspida, and bears the eighteen smaller (often quite
rudimentary) radial spines. The two other parts (opposite on both poles of
its hydrotomical axis) are the conical or cylindrical, solid, basal sheaths
of the two large equatorial spines, enveloping their major part. In
consequence of this peculiar metamorphosis of the shell the Diploconida
represent the last and the most aberrant group of all ACANTHARIA.

{795}----


Suborder I. SPHÆROPHRACTA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Shell spherical, with twenty radial beams of equal size.



Family XXXIX. #SPHÆROCAPSIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 133, figs. 7-11; Pl. 135, figs.
6-10).

_Sphærocapsida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 469.

_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with simple spherical porous shell, composed of
innumerable very small plates, each of which is pierced by one radial
porule. Twenty radial spines of equal size meeting in the centre of the
shell and disposed according to the Müllerian law of the Icosacantha,
sometimes short and enclosed in the shell, at other times long and piercing
it (rarely rudimentary or quite absent). Shell pierced therefore either by
twenty larger perspinal pores or by eighty smaller aspinal pores. Central
capsule spherical, enclosed in the porous shell.

The family #Sphærocapsida#, founded by me in 1881 for the single genus
_Sphærocapsa_, represents a very peculiar and remarkable group of the
#Acanthophracta#, very different from the five other families of this
suborder, and probably derived, independently of them, directly from the
#Acanthonida#. Whilst the lattice-shell of the five other families is
composed of the meeting branches of lateral apophyses of the twenty spines,
and its meshes are all or partly the intervals between these apophyses, in
the Sphærocapsida the spherical shell has quite another structure, and is
composed of innumerable small plates (each with one pore) which are
secreted on the surface of the spherical calymma, independently of the
twenty radial spines, which do not possess true apophyses.

In all Sphærocapsida the structure of the spherical shell is quite peculiar
and different from that of all other Radiolaria. It is composed everywhere
of innumerable very small plates or aglets, which are connected irregularly
like paving-stones, and form a single continuous layer or pavement on the
surface of the spherical calymma (Pl. 133, fig. 11, _a_; Pl. 135, figs. 8,
10). The small plates or paving-stones, which we will call "aglets," are
connected at their meeting edges by a kind of cement, and form together
with it a continuous thick capsule of acanthin. The form of the aglets is
commonly more or less irregular, roundish or polygonal, sometimes longish
(Pl. 133, fig. 11, _a_), more rarely it becomes rather regular, hexagonal,
square, or roundish (Pl. 135, fig. 8). Usually all aglets of one and the
same individual are of nearly equal size, between 0.01 and 0.02 in
diameter, rarely less or more. The outer face of the aglets is more or less
concave, so that the elevated meeting edges of the neighbouring aglets
commonly form together a prominent network of crests (Pl. 135, figs. 8,
10); rarely the meeting edges partly cover one another like squamules (Pl.
133, fig. 11, _a_). {796}Each small plate or aglet is pierced in its centre
by a single radial canalicule or porule. The dimpled surface, so produced,
resembles somewhat the dimpled plates of _Ceriaspis_, &c. Different from
these innumerable very small dimples of the surface are the twenty larger
"spinal dimples," or the concave larger plates, which are originally
pierced by the twenty radial spines. Before we describe these, we must
examine the spines themselves.

The twenty radial spines of all observed Sphærocapsida (sixteen species)
agree perfectly with those of the genus _Acanthonia_ (p. 749), and
especially with _Acanthonia tetracopa_, _Acanthonia denticulata_, &c. All
twenty spines, regularly disposed according to the Müllerian law of the
Icosacantha, are of equal size, constantly four-edged prismatic, of equal
breadth throughout their whole length. The prominent four edges are
parallel, sometimes smooth, at other times elegantly denticulated. The
central bases of the twenty spines are pyramidal, without leaf-cross, and
propped one upon another with their triangular faces, as in the majority of
the #Acanthonida#.

The relation of the twenty radial spines to the spherical shell exhibits in
the five genera described very peculiar and important differences. In the
first described genus, in _Sphærocapsa_, the spines are exactly as long as
the shell-radius, and therefore are not prominent over the surface of the
shell, with which they are firmly connected; the truncated distal end of
the spine lies therefore here in the surface of the shell itself, and is
connected with it by its four edges, between which four open aspinal pores
remain, as in _Tessaraspis_, &c. (Pl. 135, figs. 6-10). In the next allied
genus, _Astrocapsa_ (Pl. 133, figs. 9, 10), the spines are longer than the
shell-radius, and therefore more or less prominent over its surface; the
piercing part of each spine is also surrounded by four aspinal pores. In
the two following genera, _Porocapsa_ and _Cannocapsa_ (Pl. 133, figs. 7,
8), the radial spines are shorter than the shell-radius and therefore quite
hidden and withdrawn inside the shell, which they do not reach. But in the
ideal prolongation of each spine the shell is pierced by a single large
opening, the "perspinal pore" or "perspinal hole," composed of the four
united aspinal pores. Whilst in _Porocapsa_ the perspinal pores are simple,
they are prolonged in _Cannocapsa_ into cylindrical tubes, open at both
ends. The twenty perspinal holes of these Porocapsida are therefore derived
by confluence of the eighty original aspinal pores of the Astrocapsida and
preserve the same regular disposition, according to the Müllerian law of
the Icosacantha. Finally, the same law as is valid also in the last genus
is found in _Cenocapsa_; here the radial spines have completely
disappeared, and the whole skeleton is a simple sphere, but of the same
structure, and with the same twenty perspinal pores as in _Porocapsa_. It
is very interesting that this spineless _Cenocapsa_ among the ACANTHARIA
exhibits the same shell (a simple hollow sphere) as a last reduced form,
which _Cenosphæra_ among the #Sphærellaria# produces as a primitive
ancestral form of numerous genera.

{797}_The Central Capsule_ of the Sphærocapsida is spherical, constantly
smaller than the enclosing concentric shell, and separated from it by the
calymma. Its structure seems to be the same as in the #Acanthonida#, and
specially in the Astrolonchida. The pseudopodia (not yet observed) are
probably protruded only through the twenty perspinal holes or the eighty
aspinal pores.

_Definition._--Radial spines connected with the porous shell, as long as or
longer than its radius. Therefore the shell pierced by eighty aspinal pores
(four around each spine).



Genus 344. _Sphærocapsa_,[384] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 469.

_Definition._--#Sphærocapsida# with twenty radial spines as long as the
radius of the shell, without external prolongation; therefore their distal

aspinal pores.

The genus _Sphærocapsa_ is the most common form of the Sphærocapsida, and
comprises those species in which the radial spines are as long as the
radius of the shell, and therefore are connected with the margin of its
aspinal holes, but not prolonged beyond its surface.

Aspinal holes four-lobed, with broad concave, irregularly crenated and
figured margin. Four aspinal pores of each hole violin-shaped. Porules of

_Definition._--#Sphærocapsida# with twenty radial spines longer than the
radius of the shell, piercing its perspinal holes, with free external
prolongation; therefore with four aspinal pores around each spine.

The genus _Astrocapsa_ differs from the preceding _Sphærocapsa_ in the
external prolongation of the radial spines piercing the perspinal holes; it
assumes therefore the common shape of the Dorataspida more than the other
Sphærocapsida do.


{799}1. _Astrocapsa tritonis_, n. sp.

Aspinal holes circular, with smooth convex margin and four circular aspinal
pores. Porules of the shell simple, without ring and dimple. Four edges of

Aspinal holes circular, with a coronet of numerous thin parallel teeth.
Porules of the shell in dimples on irregular polygonal small plates, with
coronated ring. Four edges of the spines denticulate; their outer free part

to 200 fathoms.



Subfamily 2. POROCAPSIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Radial spines not connected with the porous shell, shorter
than its radius; therefore the shell pierced by twenty perspinal pores
(each one in the ideal radial prolongation of one spine).



{800}Genus 346. _Porocapsa_,[386] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Sphærocapsida# with twenty radial spines shorter than the
radius of the shell; therefore their distal ends not connected with the
twenty perspinal holes, which are simple, not prolonged into radial tubes.

The genus _Porocapsa_ and the following _Cannocapsa_ form together the
small sub-family of Porocapsida, distinguished by the peculiar reduction or
retrograde development of the twenty radial spines; all these twenty are
present and disposed according to the Müllerian law of the Icosacantha, but
they are shorter than the radius of the shell and therefore do not reach
it. In the ideal prolongation of the spines the shell is pierced by twenty
simple quadrangular or circular perspinal holes.


1. _Porocapsa murrayana_, n. sp. (Pl. 133, fig. 7).

Perspinal holes cruciform, with smooth thickened margin or with four short
teeth between the four lobes. Porules of the shell simple, without ring and
dimple. Four edges of the spines smooth. (Differs from _Sphærocapsa
cruciata_, Pl. 135, figs. 6, 7, living in the same locality, mainly in the
reduction of the radial spines, which do not reach the shell.)

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.28; length of the spines 0.2.

_Habitat._--North Atlantic, Færöe Channel, Gulf Stream (expedition of
H.M.S. "Triton," August 1882), John Murray, surface and in depths from 40
to 640 fathoms.


2. _Porocapsa tetrodon_, n. sp.

Perspinal holes cruciform, with four triangular prominent teeth between the
four lobes of the cross. Porules of the shell with an elevated polygonal
ring, in the bottom of a dimple. Four edges of the spines elegantly
denticulate.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.36; length of the spines 0.12.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 253, surface.


3. _Porocapsa octodon_, n. sp.

the square, and four smaller teeth on its corners. Porules of the shell
surrounded by an elevated ring with elegantly crenated irregular margin.
Four edges of the spines smooth.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.48; length of the spines 0.18.

denticulate.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.55; length of the spines 0.15.

_Habitat._--Antarctic Ocean, Station 154, surface.



Genus 347. _Cannocapsa_,[387] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Sphærocapsida# with twenty radial spines shorter than the
radius of the shell; therefore their distal ends not connected with the
twenty perspinal holes, which are prolonged outside into radial tubes (each
one in the radial ideal prolongation of one inner spine).

The genus _Cannocapsa_, exhibits the same peculiar reduction of the radial
spines as the foregoing _Porocapsa_; the spines are also here shorter than
the shell-radius and do not therefore reach the perspinal holes of the
shell. But whilst these latter are simple in _Porocapsa_, they are
prolonged into radial tubules in _Cannocapsa_; the outer surface bears
therefore twenty such cylindrical tubules, separated by a short distance
from the inner enclosed spines, but disposed quite regularly according to
the law of Icosacantha.


1. _Cannocapsa osculata_, n. sp.

Perspinal holes prolonged into short cylindrical tubuli, the length of
which about equals their diameter. Both ends of the tubuli with smooth
thickened margin. Poruli of the shell simple, without ring and dimple. Four
edges of the spines smooth; their length equals about four-fifths of the
shell-radius.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.24; length of the spines 0.09, of
the tubuli 0.01.

_Habitat._--North Atlantic, Færöe Channel (Gulf Stream), surface, John
Murray.


2. _Cannocapsa stethoscopium_, n. sp. (Pl. 133, fig. 8).

Perspinal holes prolonged into cylindrical tubuli, half as long as the
shell radius. Both ends of the tubuli with smooth thin trumpet-shaped
margins. Poruli of the shell simple, without ring and dimple. Four edges of
the spines smooth; their length about equals three-fourths of the
shell-radius.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.2; length of the spines 0.08, of the
tubuli 0.05.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic (west of Tristan da Cunha), Station 333,
surface.


3. _Cannocapsa tubulosa_, n. sp.

Perspinal holes prolonged into cylindrical tubuli, which are as long as or
longer then the shell-radius. Both ends of the tubuli with smooth thickened
margin. Poruli of the shell simple, {802}without ring and dimple. Four
edges of the spines smooth; their length scarcely equals half the
shell-radius.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.15; length of the spines 0.03, of
the tubuli 0.08.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic (east coast of Patagonia), Station 318, surface.



Subfamily 3. CENOCAPSIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Radial spines completely reduced and absent; shell cavity
therefore simple; shell pierced by twenty perspinal pores (each placed in
the direction of one radial spine which has disappeared).



Genus 348. _Cenocapsa_,[388] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Sphærocapsida# without radial spines, with simple cavity of
the spherical shell, which is pierced by twenty perspinal holes (each one
placed in the radial direction of one spine which has disappeared).

The genus _Cenocapsa_ comprises only a single species, but is very
remarkable in that it is the most reduced form among all Sphærocapsida. The
twenty radial spines of the Icosacantha have perfectly disappeared by
complete retrograde metamorphosis, and the only evidence of their former
existence (in the ancestral genus _Porocapsa_) are the twenty perspinal
holes remaining in the shell. _Cenocapsa_ is the only form of ACANTHARIA
which possesses no radial spines.


1. _Cenocapsa nirvana_, n. sp. (133, fig. 11, 11_a_, 11_c_).

Perspinal holes four-lobed, cruciform, with four short triangular teeth
between the four lobes of the cross. Poruli of the shell in the bottom of
an elliptical dimple surrounded by an elevated ring.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.2 to 0.3, of the aspinal holes 0.02.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 248, surface.



Family XL. #DORATASPIDA#, Haeckel (Pls. 134-138).

_Dorataspida_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 412.

_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with simple spherical lattice-shell, composed of
the branched apophyses of twenty equal radial spines meeting in its centre
and disposed according to the Müllerian law of Icosacantha. Central capsule
spherical, enclosed in the fenestrated shell.

The family #Dorataspida# is the most important family of the
#Acanthophracta#, or of those ACANTHARIA in which the radial spines are
connected by a complete extracapsular lattice-shell. The Dorataspida
represent probably the ancestral {803}stock of this whole order, with the
exception of the Sphærocapsida. The four following families of the order
may be easily derived from the Dorataspida. The number of genera
(seventeen) and of species (one hundred and eight) is in this family
greater than in the other five families together. When I constituted that
family in my Monograph 1862, it comprised only one genus, _Dorataspis_,
with seven species. The nearly allied genus _Haliommatidium_ (_Phatnaspis_)
belongs to the Belonaspida.

The Dorataspida differ from the other #Acanthophracta# in the simple
spherical lattice-shell, which is composed of the meeting apophyses of the
twenty radial spines. In three other families of the suborder the shell is
not spherical, but ellipsoidal (Belonaspida), discoidal (Hexalaspida), or
diploconical (Diploconida). In the Phractopeltida the spherical shell is
double, composed of two concentric lattice-spheres. In the Sphærocapsida
the simple spherical shell is not composed of the apophyses of the spines,
but of innumerable small plates.

The family Dorataspida may be divided into two very different subfamilies,
which are probably derived, independently of one another, from  two
different subfamilies of the Astrolonchida. The first subfamily,
Diporaspida, exhibits on each radial spine two opposite apophyses, like its
ancestral group, the Phractacanthida (p. 753); whereas the second
subfamily, Tessaraspida, possesses on each radial spine four crossed
apophyses (opposite in pairs), like its ancestral group, the Stauracanthida
(p. 758). Therefore the composition of the spherical shell, produced by the
meeting branches of the tangential apophyses, is essentially different in
the two subfamilies: in the Diporaspida each radial spine is surrounded by
two opposite primary aspinal meshes, in the Tessaraspida by four crossed
primary aspinal meshes.

Another principle of division may be established for the whole family by
the different mode of composition of the shell, and regarding this
important difference we may distinguish also two different subfamilies as
#Cladophracta# and #Peltophracta#. In the first and simpler subfamily, the
#Cladophracta#, the shell is composed totally (or sometimes partially) of
the meeting branches of the apophyses of the neighbouring spines; but in
each single spine (or in the most part of them) the branches of the
apophyses are not united, and form no lattice-plate (Pl. 137, figs. 1 to
8). Whereas in the #Peltophracta# the shell is composed constantly of
twenty perforated plates, as in each single spine the branches of its
apophyses are united and form a fenestrated shield with two or four (and
sometimes numerous) pores (Pls. 135, 136, 138).

In the Diporaspida as well as in the Tessaraspida we find numerous
representatives of the two groups of the #Cladophracta# and of the
#Peltophracta#; therefore the whole family of Dorataspida may be divided
into four different tribes. The Diporaspida (with two opposite apophyses on
each spine) are partly #Cladophracta# (the Phractaspida, Pl. 137, figs.
1-4), partly #Peltophracta# (the Ceriaspida, Pl. 138). On the other hand
the Tessaraspida (with four crossed apophyses on each {804}spine) are also
partly #Cladophracta# (the Stauraspida, Pl. 137, figs. 5-8), partly
#Peltophracta# (the Lychnaspida, Pls. 135-136). The differences and
relations of these tribes are placed synoptically in the following table:--

All Dorataspida are true Icosacantha, and the twenty spines, composing the
spherical shell, are equally developed, regularly disposed according to the
Müllerian law, and of equal size; also the distance of their plates from
the common centre is equal. Nevertheless they are never of perfectly the
same form; in consequence of their peculiar disposition in five zones (each
with four spines) certain slight differences are effected, so that with
accurate knowledge of the peculiar shell-composition it is generally not
difficult to distinguish the spines of the equatorial, the two tropical,
and the two polar zones.

Already the central bases, by which the twenty spines are united in the
centre of the sphere, exhibit certain differences in the five zones.
Commonly these bases are small pyramids, all meeting with their apex in the
centre, and the triangular faces of the neighbouring pyramids are supported
one upon another. The four equatorial pyramids are commonly six-sided, the
other sixteen five-sided; but sometimes there are eight six-sided and
twelve five-sided basal pyramids; two opposite polar spines on each pole
having a six-sided base (like the four equatorial), the other two polar
spines on each pole having a five-sided base (like the eight tropical).
Rarely the central bases are perfectly grown together, forming a single
spherical central piece of acanthin.

The three different fundamental forms of radial spines, which are found in
all ACANTHARIA, the cylindrical, the two-edged, and the four-edged (spines
with circular, with elliptical, and with square transverse section
respectively) occur also in the different groups of Dorataspida; but
commonly the two-edged or compressed form is prevalent in the Diporaspida,
the four-edged or quadrangular form in the Tessaraspida. In the majority of
species the spines are thickened in the shell-face, where the apophyses
arise, and thinner towards the two ends. Usually the outer or distal part
of the spine (outside the shell) is longer than the inner or proximal part
(inside {805}the shell). The distal apex is commonly simple, conical or
pyramidal, rarely bifid or truncate. The edges of the spines are commonly
smooth, rarely denticulate or serrate.

The apophyses, or the lateral transverse processes of the radial spines, in
the Dorataspida assume the greatest variety and complexity in form, size,
mode of ramification, and in composition of the shell. An expert and
practised observer may determine easily the range of each spine, whether it
be an equatorial (_c_), or a tropical (_b_, _d_), or a polar spine (_a_,
_e_, Pls. 133-138). The two opposite apophyses of the Diporaspida, as well
as the four crossed apophyses of the Tessaraspida, lie constantly in
certain meridian planes of the spine, which have a legitimate signification
for each of the five zones. The comparative morphology of this regular
disposition of the apophyses and the regular meeting of their branches is
of the greatest interest, and necessary for the complete understanding of
the complicated structure of these wonderful shells.

The pores or meshes of the spherical shell, offering the most varied forms,
may generally be divided into two different groups, into sutural and parmal
meshes. The sutural pores are bordered by the meeting branches of the
apophyses of two, three, or four neighbouring spines, and therefore also by
the sutures in which they meet. The parmal pores on the other hand are
bordered only by the united branches of the apophyses of a single spine and
pierce the shield or lattice-plate formed by them. Therefore the
shell-meshes of the #Cladophracta# are all sutural pores (Pl. 137, figs.
1-8; rarely and only in a part of the spines parmal pores also: _Zonaspis_,
_Dodecaspis_); whereas the shell-meshes of the #Peltophracta#, piercing the
shields or lattice-plates of all twenty spines, are always partly sutural,
partly parmal pores (Pls. 135, 136, 138). The parmal pores again may be
divided into two different groups--aspinal and coronal pores. Aspinal pores
("ad spinam") are those which lie immediately on the sides of the radial
spine and are bordered by the primary branches of its apophyses; therefore
constantly only two in the Diporaspida, four in the Tessaraspida. Coronal
pores on the contrary are those which lie in the periphery of the
lattice-plates, surrounding in a circle or crown the aspinal pores and not
touching the spine itself. In _Dorataspis_, _Ceriaspis_, _Tessaraspis_,
_Lychnaspis_, &c., all parmal meshes are only aspinal pores (Pl. 135, figs.
2-5; Pl. 136); whilst in _Coscinaspis_, _Acontaspis_, _Icosaspis_,
_Hylaspis_, &c., one part of the parmal pores is aspinal, one part coronal
(Pl. 136). The number, form, and size of the coronal pores is very variable
and often very large (sometimes more than a hundred in one plate).

The #Cladophracta# exhibit a comparatively simple shell-formation; either
all twenty spines or at least a part of them not forming lattice-plates.
The most primitive form among these is _Phractaspis_ (Pl. 137, figs. 1, 2).
The forty apophyses of its twenty spines are simply forked, and their
eighty fork-branches united by forty sutures, enclosing twenty-two sutural
meshes: two square polar meshes (between the four polar spines on the poles
of the spineless axis, _a a a a_ and _e e e e_); eight triangular
{806}circumpolar meshes (each between two polar and one tropical spine, _a
b a_ and _e d e_); eight quadrangular tropical meshes (each between one
polar, one equatorial, and two tropical spines, _a b c b_ and _e d c d_);
and four rhomboidal equatorial meshes (between two tropical and two
equatorial spines, _c b c d_). If the fork-branches be again forked
(_Phractaspidium_, Pl. 137, fig. 3), the number of the sutures and sutural
meshes is doubled, and the same is the case in _Stauraspis_, the most
simple form of the Tessaraspida.

A peculiar small group, and an interesting transition for the
#Cladophracta# to the #Peltophracta#, is presented by the Zonaspida among
the Tessaraspida (_Zonaspis_ and _Dodecaspis_). Here only one part of the
radial spines bears lattice-plates, the other part not. In _Zonaspis_ the
four equatorial spines bear lattice-plates, the sixteen other only free
branches of the apophyses. In _Dodecaspis_ twelve spines are provided with
lattice-plates (four equatorial and eight polar spines), whilst the eight
other (tropical) spines are devoid of them.

The #Peltophracta# exhibit a great variety in the form and composition of
their twenty lattice-plates or fenestrated shields. In the most simple case
(a part of _Dorataspis_ and _Diporaspis_) the shell is composed of four
(equatorial) hexagonal plates, and sixteen pentagonal plates (four tropical
and four polar); in this case the four polar plates meet on each pole in
one common point. More commonly, however, the shell seems to be composed of
eight hexagonal plates (four equatorial and the four polar spines of the
hydrotomical plane) and twelve pentagonal plates (eight tropical and the
four polar spines of the geotomical plane); in this case only two
(hexagonal) polar plates meet on each pole in a suture which separates the
two other (pentagonal) polar plates (Pl. 138, fig. 4). In the majority of
the Dorataspida the composition of the shell is much more complicated and
often very difficult to understand. Often the surface of the plates is
covered with a network of elevated crests, by which concave blind dimples
are separated (_Ceriaspis_, _Hystrichaspis_, Pl. 138); and sometimes these
dimples become pierced by coronal pores (Pl. 138, fig. 11, &c.).

Peculiar by-spines or "accessory spines" cover the outer surface of the
shell in a great part of Dorataspida, and commonly these most
characteristic by-spines are not placed radially, but parallel to the
radial spine, from the lattice-plate of which they arise (Pl. 135, figs. 1,
5; Pl. 137, figs. 4-8; Monogr. d. Radiol., 1862, Taf. xxi. figs. 8, 9).
They are commonly placed perpendicular to the sutural condyles, or the
branch-ends of the apophyses; so that close to each suture arises a pair of
divergent by-spines, belonging to the meeting apophyses of the two
neighbouring spines, which meet in the suture (Pl. 137, fig. 4). Rarely
these thin, bristle-shaped by-spines are quite simple and straight,
commonly they undulate or are zigzag and often armed with recurved hooks.
Sometimes they are also forked or arborescent (Pl. 138, fig. 7).

_The Central Capsule_ of the Dorataspida is constantly spherical and about
one-third smaller than the enclosing shell, from which it is separated by
the spherical calymma. {807}The membrane of the central capsule is commonly
rather thin, and pierced by the twenty radial spines, meeting in the centre
of the capsule. Between these lie innumerable small pores for the radiating
pseudopodia; however, in many cases (and perhaps constantly) these pores
exhibit a certain regular disposition. In many species the central capsule
encloses Xanthellæ or symbiotic yellow unicellular Algæ. The nucleus
becomes cleft very early in the majority of Dorataspida.

{808}Subfamily 1. DIPORASPIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with twenty radial spines, each of which bears
two opposite apophyses. The spherical shell is composed either of the
meeting branches of these apophyses (Phractaspida), or of twenty perforated
plates, produced by concrescence of their branches (Ceriaspida).



A. Tribe I. #Phractaspida#, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# without perforated plates; the spherical shell
is composed only of the meeting branches of the two opposite apophyses,
which arise from each radial spine. Therefore the meshes of the shell are
all sutural.



Genus 349. _Phractaspis_,[389] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 467.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# without perforated plates; shell composed only
of the meeting branches of the two opposite apophyses, which arise from
each radial spine. Condyles of the branch-ends without by-spines.

The genus _Phractaspis_ is the most simple and primitive form among all
Dorataspida, and may be regarded as the common ancestral form either of
this whole family, or at least of its first subfamily, the Diporaspida. In
all members of this subfamily the spherical shell is composed of twenty
radial spines, each of which bears two opposite apophyses; but the mode of
composition is different in the two tribes of the subfamily, in the
Phractaspida and Ceriaspida. In the simpler tribe, the Phractaspida, the
shell is composed only of the meeting branches of the apophyses of
neighbouring spines; there are no peculiar perforated plates or shields. In
the Ceriaspida, however, both apophyses of each single spine form a
perforated plate or shield by union of their branches, and the shell is
formed of the meeting edges of these shields. Of course the Ceriaspida must
be derived from the simpler Phractaspida. _Phractaspis_, as the common
ancestral form of both, exhibits a very simple structure of the shell (Pl.
137, figs. 1, 2). Commonly, if the fork-branches of each apophysis be not
again branched, the shell possesses only twenty-two large meshes and forty
sutures. More rarely their number increases, the fork-branches of the
apophyses being again branched (_Phractaspidium_, Pl. 137, fig. 3).



Subgenus 1. _Phractasparium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Shell with twenty-two meshes, and forty sutures, each spine
with only four branches, its two apophyses being simply forked.


{809}1. _Phractaspis prototypus_, n. sp. (Pl. 137, fig. 2).

Radial spines cylindrical, thin, pointed; the outer and inner halves of
nearly equal size. Each spine bears in its middle part two opposite
apophyses, which are simply forked; the four condyles of each spine (or the
thickened ends of the fork-branches) are united with the meeting condyles
of the neighbouring spines by sutures. Therefore the network of the
spherical shell is composed of twenty-two large meshes: two square polar
meshes on each pole (_a a a a_ and _e e e e_); eight triangular circumpolar
meshes (each between two polar and one tropical spine, _a b a_ and _e d
e_); eight tropical rhomboidal meshes (each between one polar, one
equatorial, and two tropical spines: _a b c b_ and _e d c d_); and four
rhomboidal equatorial meshes (each between two tropical and two equatorial
spines _c b c d_).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.1, of the meshes 0.03 to 0.04;
breadth of the spines and bars 0.005.

_Habitat._--Cosmopolitan; Mediterranean (Corfu), Atlantic (Stations 348,
354), Indian Ocean (Ceylon), Pacific (Stations 253, 265, 274), &c.,
surface.


2. _Phractaspis complanata_, n. sp. (Pl. 137, fig. 1).

Radial spines leaf-shaped, strongly compressed, two-edged, pointed; their
outer part longer than the inner. Each spine with two opposite apophyses
which are simply forked, therefore with four condyles. The network with
forty sutures and twenty-two large meshes, as in the foregoing species. The
broad faces of the eight polar spines lie in two meridian planes, of the
four equatorial spines in the equatorial plane, of the eight tropical
spines in two planes parallel to the latter. The planes of the leaf-shaped
fork-branches lie in the spherical face.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.1, of the meshes 0.02 to 0.03;
breadth of the fork-branches 0.012.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic, Station 343, surface.


3. _Phractaspis condylophora_, n. sp.

Radial spines quadrangular, thin; their outer pyramidal part shorter than
the inner. Each spine with four branches, its two opposite apophyses being
simply forked. The eighty condyles (or sutural ends of the branches) much
thickened, twice to four times as broad as the branches themselves. Network
with forty sutures and twenty-two large meshes, as in both foregoing
species.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.12, of the meshes 0.03 to 0.04;
breadth of the condyles 0.01.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 288, surface.


4. _Phractaspis bipennis_, Haeckel.

  _Dorataspis bipennis_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 413, Taf.
  xxi. figs. 1, 2.

  _Phractasplenium bipenne_, Haeckel, 1882, Manuscript.

Radial spines very thin, quadrangular; their outer pyramidal part shorter
than the inner. Each spine with four bent branches, its two opposite
apophyses being simply forked. Eighty {810}condyles, very thin, pointed. In
the specimens of this remarkable species, which I first observed in
Messina, two opposite equatorial spines had quite free apophyses, not
connected with the neighbouring spines; therefore the thin lattice-work of
the shell exhibited only thirty-six sutures and twenty meshes (two meshes
with six sutures, six meshes with four sutures, and twelve meshes with
three sutures). In similar specimens, which I afterwards observed in the
Canary Islands, all four equatorial spines were connected in the same
manner with the neighbouring spines; therefore they possessed forty sutures
and twenty-two meshes, like _Phractaspis prototypus_ (Pl. 137, fig. 2).
Perhaps the Mediterranean species represents a peculiar genus,
_Phractasplenium bipenne_.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.1, of the meshes 0.03 to 0.05;
breadth of the spines 0.002.

_Habitat._--Mediterranean (Messina), Canary Islands (Lanzerote), surface.



Subgenus 2. _Phractaspidium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Shell with forty to eighty or more meshes, and eighty to one
hundred or more sutures. Each spine with six to eight or more branches, its
two apophyses being doubly forked or more ramified.


5. _Phractaspis constricta_, n. sp. (Pl. 137, fig. 3).

Radial spines strongly compressed, two-edged, pointed; their outer half
twice constricted and somewhat longer than the inner half. Each spine with
two opposite forked apophyses, the branches of which are again forked;
therefore eight condyles on each spine. The network of the spherical shell
with eighty sutures and sixty-two meshes (twenty-two large primary meshes
and forty smaller secondary meshes, the latter between the distal
fork-branches).

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.11, of the large meshes 0.04 to
0.05, of the small meshes 0.01; breadth of the spines 0.01.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic, Station 348, depth 2450 fathoms.

  _Acanthometra cataphracta_, J. Müller, 1858, Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d.
  Wiss. Berlin, p. 49, Taf. x. figs. 7, 8.

  _Dorataspis cataphracta_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p. 415.

Radial spines thin, quadrangular; their outer pyramidal part shorter than
the inner. Each spine with six to eight condyles, the fork-branches of
their two opposite apophyses being (all or partly) again forked. The
network with sixty to eighty sutures and meshes: sometimes as regular as in
the preceding species, at other times more or less irregular.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.1, of the meshes 0.02 to 0.04;
breadth of the bars 0.004 to 0.008.

_Habitat._--Mediterranean (Cette), Müller (Messina), Haeckel; North
Atlantic, Station 353, surface.



{811}Genus 350. _Pleuraspis_,[390] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 467.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# without perforated plates; shell composed only
of the meeting branches of the two opposite apophyses, which arise from
each radial spine. Condyles of the branch ends bearing by-spines.

The genus _Pleuraspis_ has quite the same structure of the shell as the
foregoing _Phractaspis_, and differs from it only in the development of
external by-spines; commonly each condyle of the branch end of the
apophyses bears one zigzag by-spine, which is directed parallel to the
radial main-spine from which the apophyses arise. Therefore each suture of
the shell is armed with two divergent by-spines (Pl. 137, fig. 4).



Subgenus 1. _Pleurasparium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Shell regularly developed with twenty-two meshes and forty
sutures (sometimes twenty to twenty-four meshes and thirty-six to
forty-eight sutures); each spine commonly with four branches, its two
apophyses being simply forked.


1. _Pleuraspis horrida_, n. sp. (Pl. 137, fig. 4).

Radial  spines roundish, somewhat compressed, very thick, conical, pointed
at both ends, outer part nearly twice as long as the inner. Two apophyses
of each spine simply forked, with short and broad branches and thickened
condyles.  Forty sutures, very broad.  Twenty-two large meshes three to
four times as broad as the bars. By-spines much developed, as long as the
radius, zigzag, with alternating recurved hooks.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.15, of the meshes 0.04 to 0.06;
breadth of the bars 0.01 to 0.015.

_Habitat._--Tropical Pacific (east of Philippines), Station 215, surface.


2. _Pleuraspis amphithecta_, n. sp.

{813}B. Tribe II. #Ceriaspida#, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida#, the spherical shell of which is composed of
twenty perforated plates, produced by union of the branches of the two

Genus 351. _Dorataspis_,[391] Haeckel, 1860, Monatsber. d. k. preuss. Akad.
d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 811.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with twenty plates, which are perforated by
forty aspinal pores (two pores in each plate). Surface of the shell without
combs, dimples, and by-spines.

The genus _Dorataspis_ opens the long series of the Ceriaspida, or of those
Dorataspida in which the shell is composed of twenty plates, each of which
is perforated by two primary aspinal pores. This tribe has arisen from the
simpler Phractaspida by reunion of the branches of the apophyses in each
single spine. If in _Phractaspis_, their common ancestral form  (Pl. 137,
figs. 1, 2), the neighbouring fork-branches of both opposite apophyses in
each radial spine become recurved and united, they will produce a shield,
which is perforated by two pores and between them by the spine itself.
These two "primary aspinal pores" are characteristic of all Ceriaspida;
among these _Dorataspis_ itself is the most simple form. Its shell exhibits
therefore constantly forty aspinal pores, and besides these a variable
number of "sutural pores" (in the sutures between the twenty plates). If in
each suture there be only a single pore, we get on the whole fifty-two or
fifty-four pores; if in each suture there be two or three pores, that
number becomes doubled or tripled.

forty aspinal pores (two pores in each plate). Surface of the shell without
combs and dimples, but armed with numerous by-spines.

The genus _Diporaspis_ has the same characteristic structure of the shell
as the typical _Dorataspis_, and differs from it only in the development of
numerous by-spines on the surface. The number of the sutures between the
twenty plates is sometimes fifty-two, at other times fifty-four, and in
each suture we find occasionally a single pore, at other times two or three
such pores.



Subgenus 1. _Diporasparium_.

_Definition._--Shell with fifty-two sutures, four polar plates on each pole

pores). {817}Radial spines strongly compressed, two-edged; outer half
shorter than the inner. By-spines undulate, half as long as the radius.

Subgenus 2. _Diporaspidium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Shell with fifty-four sutures, four polar plates on each
pole of the main axis different in pairs: two major hexagonal meeting in a

(separated by that suture). Shell therefore composed of eight hexagonal
plates (four equatorial and four polar) and of twelve hexagonal plates
(eight tropical and four polar).

elegant circles around the pores (a small coronel around each sutural pore,
a large one around each couple of aspinal pores).

pores 0.01.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface



Genus 353. _Orophaspis_,[393] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 468.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with twenty plates, which are perforated by
forty aspinal pores (two pores in each plate). Surface of the shell without
combs, dimples, and by-spines. Each radial spine bears outside of the shell
two opposite free apophyses, which are either simple or branched.

The genus _Orophaspis_ differs not only from its ancestral form,
_Dorataspis_, but from all other Dorataspida in the development of peculiar
free apophyses on the radial spines, outside the shell. These apophyses,
two being opposite on each spine, appear as a repetition of the primary
apophyses of _Phractaspis_; they are either simple or branched, and
sometimes the branches are united together, forming an outer free shield
with two or four pores. These outer plates represent the beginning of a
second outer shell and form the transition to _Phractopelta_, the ancestral
form of the Phractopeltida.

Parmal pores of the shell circular, of the same size as the sutural pores
and the bars. Radial spines sword-shaped, two-edged, very broad; each spine

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with twenty plates, which are perforated by
forty aspinal pores (two pores in each plate). Surface of the shell with

The genus _Ceriaspis_ has the same structure of the shell, as its ancestral
form _Dorataspis_, differing from it only in the development of high combs
or crests, which form on the surface of the shell a peculiar elevated
network. The dimples or funnel-shaped pits between these combs are either
all or partly perforated by the pores of the shell. Both the aspinal pores
of each plate are usually placed in one common dimple, whilst each sutural
pore is placed in its peculiar smaller dimple.

Subgenus 2. _Ceriaspidium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Shell-surface with funnel-shaped dimples (commonly one
hundred and seventy-six or one hundred and eighty-two), which on the bottom
are partly closed, partly perforated by one aperture (or by a pair of
pores). The blind dimples are placed on the corners of the twenty plates,

hexagonal equatorial and twenty-four on the four hexagonal polar plates,
two opposite on each pole; forty on the eight pentagonal tropical plates
and twenty on the four pentagonal polar plates, two opposite on each pole).
Between the blind dimples there are usually seventy-two to seventy-four
perforated {821}dimples, twenty larger parmal dimples (enclosing a radial
spine and  a couple of aspinal pores) and fifty-two to fifty-four sutural
dimples (sometimes one  hundred or more), each of which encloses one

Shell with numerous (one hundred to two hundred?) funnel-shaped dimples,
each of which is pierced at the bottom by one or more pores. Twenty larger
dimples in the centre of the plates are pierced by the radial main-spines;

Genus 356. _Coscinaspis_,[396] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Doratispida# with twenty plates, which are perforated by
eighty to two hundred or more parmal pores (two aspinal and two to ten or
more coronal pores in each plate). Surface without by-spines.

The genus _Coscinaspis_, together with the following nearly allied genus
_Acontaspis_, may be separated from the other Ceriaspida as a peculiar
tribe, _Coscinaspida_. This tribe is characterised by the larger number of
the parmal pores. Whilst in all other Ceriaspida this number is constantly
forty (only two pores in each plate), here it may be from eighty to two
hundred or more; in each shield the two primary "aspinal pores" are
surrounded by a circle of two to ten or more (commonly eight to twelve)
"coronal pores." The number of sutural pores in this group is also usually
larger.

the two aspinal pores of each plate narrow, lanceolate, ten to twelve times
as long as broad and half as long as the radius of each plate. Coronal
pores irregular, polygonal, very numerous (two hundred to three hundred on

  _Dorataspis parmipora_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, Atlas.

Shell thin walled, with smooth surface, without crests and dimples. There
are no sutural pores, since all twenty plates are connected by perfect
sinuate sutures (therefore this excellent species may perhaps better
represent a peculiar genus, called by me in 1866 _Craniaspis_). All pores
are parmal pores; each plate with two elliptical aspinal pores, which are
twice to five times broader than the numerous, roundish irregularly
scattered coronal pores (thirty to fifty occurring on each plate). The
radial spines are quite internal, that is, not prolonged on the outside of
the shell; in this respect they resemble those of _Sphærocapsa_.

pores of the shell nearly of the same size and of similar form, about as
broad as the bars between them, and about two hundred in number, viz.,

circular pores: six in the angles of each equatorial plate, and five in the
angles of each tropical and polar plate; if the disposition be quite
regular, one hundred and four or one hundred and eight). Radial spines
short, rudimentary, conical.

_Definition._--Surface of the shell dimply, with a network of prominent
crests.


9. _Coscinaspis ceriopora_, n. sp.

Shell thick-walled, with numerous (one hundred and sixty to two hundred?)
funnel-shaped dimples, which are separated by prominent crests; on the
bottom of each dimple there is a simple or double circular pore. If this
species be quite regularly developed, it closely resembles the preceding,
differing from it mainly in the prominent combs of the surface. It
resembles also _Ceriaspis favosa_, Pl. 138, fig. 6; but whilst in this
latter the majority of the dimples are blind, here they are all perforated.
The twenty aspinal dimples (in the centre of each plate) present at the
bottom a couple of pores, all other dimples a single pore. Among the latter
there are fifty to sixty sutural pores and one hundred to one hundred and
ten coronal pores, viz., six in each equatorial plate, and five in each of
the other plates; but the number is not quite constant. Radial spines
strong, in the inner part cylindrical, in the outer conical.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with twenty plates, which are perforated by
eighty to two hundred or more parmal pores (in each plate two aspinal and
two to ten or more coronal pores). Surface covered with by-spines.

The genus _Acontaspis_ has the same characteristic structure of the shell
as _Ceriaspis_, differing from it only in the presence of numerous
by-spines. Each plate is perforated by four to sixteen or more (commonly
ten to twelve) parmal pores, the two central of which are primary "aspinal
pores," all the others being secondary "coronal pores."

perforated by about three hundred pores of different sizes: forty aspinal
pores elliptical, about as large as the irregular (fifty to sixty) sutural
pores, and two to four times as broad as the small circular coronal pores
(eight to twelve being on each plate, altogether about two hundred).
Between the pores numerous short conical by-spines. Radial main spines

peripora_, Pl. 138, fig. 1, but with broad lanceolate spines and numerous
short by-spines.)

and ninety) dimples, which are separated by an elevated network of
prominent crests. In the centre of each plate a larger dimple with a couple
of aspinal pores, surrounded by a corona of ten or twelve smaller dimples,
each of which contains a single pore (a coronal and sutural alternately).
All pores circular or roundish, nearly of the same size. If the shell be
quite regularly developed, there are fifty to sixty sutural pores and one
hundred to one hundred and ten coronal pores (six in each equatorial plate,
five in each of the other plates). The knobs of the meeting crests are
conical, and bear each a simple short by-spine. Radial main spines
compressed, at the distal end spear-shaped, with a rhomboidal plate below
the apex, about as long as the radius.

nearly of the same size. Each node of the crested network bears a stout
by-spine, which is forked {830}on the base, with two divergent straight
branches (similar to those of _Hystrichaspis furcata_, Pl. 138, fig. 9).
Radial main spines two-edged, sword-like, nearly as long as the diameter of
the shell.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.13, of the pores 0.008.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 272, surface.

(three hundred to four hundred or more?) deep funnel-shaped dimples, each
of which is perforated by a small circular pore (forty aspinal, two hundred
to three hundred coronal, and fifty to one hundred sutural pores?). The
high crests between the dimples bear very numerous simple by-spines, nearly
half as long as the radius, so that the shell appears covered with hairs.
Radial main spines very long and thin, cylindrical, longer than the
diameter of the shell.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.2, of the pores 0.012.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 244, surface.



Subfamily 2. TESSARASPIDA, Haeckel.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with twenty radial spines, each of which bears

A. Tribe II. #Stauraspida#, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 467.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with spherical shell, which is composed either
of the meeting branches of the four crossed apophyses only, or exhibits
four to twelve perforated plates which are produced by the crossed
apophyses of four to twelve radial spines (but never of all twenty spines).
Each plate bears four crossed pores.



Genus 358. _Stauraspis_,[398] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 467.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# without perforated plates; shell composed only
of the meeting branches of the four crossed apophyses, which arise
(opposite in pairs) from each radial spine. Condyles of the branch-ends
without by-spines.

The genus _Stauraspis_ is the most simple and primitive form among all
Tessaraspida, or that subfamily of Dorataspida, in which the shell is
composed of twenty {831}radial spines, each of which bears four crossed
apophyses.  The subfamily may be divided into two different tribes, the
Stauraspida and Lychnaspida.  In the Stauraspida either all twenty spines,
or a part of them, bear no perforated plates, and the shell is composed
wholly or partially of the meeting branches of their apophyses. In the
Lychnaspida, however, the four apophyses of each single spine form, by
reunion of their recurved branches, a plate or shield with four crossed
aspinal pores. The Lychnaspida represent therefore a more developed stage
in the shell-formation than the simpler Stauraspida. _Stauraspis_, as the
common ancestral form of both, may be derived phylogenetically from
_Xiphacantha_ or _Stauracantha_, which differ only by the apophyses or
branches of the apophyses not meeting.  These branches (originally eight on
each spine) are either simple or again branched.

Radial spines thin, quadrangular, prismatic; outer and inner half nearly of
equal length. Central bases pyramidal, with wing-like edges. Four apophyses

species greatly resemble the simplest forms of _Phractaspis_ (Pl. 137,
figs. 1, 2); they differ from these, however, by the equal size and
distance of the four branches of each spine, which thus form a rectangular
cross.

to 0.01, of the bars 0.002.

The genus _Echinaspis_ exhibits the same structure of the shell as its

by-spines on the sutural condyli.


1. _Echinaspis dichotoma_, n. sp.

Radial spines cylindrical, thin, outer half longer than the inner. Four
apophyses of each spine simply forked (or partly with bifid fork-branches);
therefore each spine usually possesses eight (sometimes ten to twelve)
sutural condyles. Meshes of the shell ten to twelve times as broad as the
bars. Each condyle bears a zigzag by-spine, half as long as the radius.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.12, of the spines 0.004 to 0.006.

three times as long as the inner. Four apophyses of each spine simply
forked (or partly with bifid fork-branches); each spine with eight to
twelve sutural condyles. Meshes of the shell fifteen to twenty-five times
as broad as the bars. Each condyle bears a simple bristle-shaped by-spine,
nearly as long as the radius.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.11; breadth of the spines and bars
0.002.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic, Station 333, surface.

as broad as in the inner half. Four apophyses of each spine doubly forked
or dichotomously (more or less irregularly) branched; each spine with
sixteen to twenty-four sutural condyles. Meshes of the shell four to eight
times as broad as the bars. Each condyle bears a zigzag by-spine, one-third
as long as the radius.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.15; breadth of the spines 0.004 to
0.01, of the bars 0.002.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 266, surface.



Genus 360. _Zonaspis_,[400] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with four plates, each of which is perforated
by four crossed aspinal pores; these four plates are formed by the united
branches of the other spines (eight polar and eight tropical) form no
lattice-plates by union. Each condyle bears a by-spine.

The genus _Zonaspis_ differs from all other Dorataspida in the peculiar
formation of the four equatorial spines, which form by union of the
recurved branches of their apophyses four perforated plates (each with four
crossed pores), whilst the branches of the sixteen other plates do not
unite to form plates, but simply meet the branches of the neighboring
spines.


1. _Zonaspis fragilis_, n. sp.

Radial spines very thin and long, cylindrical. Four meshes of each
equatorial plate pentagonal, ten to twelve times as broad as the bars.

Radial spines cylindrical in the inner half, with thickened pyramidal bases
(fig. 3), conical in the outer half; both halves of equal length. The four
meshes of each equatorial plate egg-shaped, four to six times as broad as
the bars. By-spines zigzag, half as long as the radius.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.15, of the parmal meshes 0.015.

_Habitat._--Tropical Pacific (east coast off Philippines), Station 275,
surface.

_Habitat._--Equatorial Atlantic, Station 347, surface.



Genus 361. _Dodecaspis_,[401] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with twelve plates, each of which is
perforated by four crossed aspinal pores; these twelve plates are formed by
the united branches of the apophyses of four equatorial and eight polar
spines. The branches of the apophyses of the eight tropical spines form no
lattice-plates by union. Each condyle bears a by-spine.

The genus _Dodecaspis_ differs from all other Dorataspida in the peculiar
composition of its shell; twelve spines (four equatorial and eight polar
spines) form by union of the branches of their apophyses twelve plates,
each of which exhibits four crossed pores, whilst the eight other
(tropical) spines form no perforated plates, but simply unite with the
neighbouring spines by meeting branches. Some irregularity is often to be
found in this genus; instead of four pores in each plate there may be two
closed, the other two which are opposite being open. Several times I
observed a peculiar "hemihedral" variety: only six spines of one meridian
plane (the two equatorial and the four polar spines of the "hydrotomical"
plane) exhibited complete shields, whilst the branches of the other
fourteen plates remained open. This "hemihedral" form may perhaps represent
a peculiar genus, _Hemiaspis_.


1. _Dodecaspis tricinata_, n. sp. (Pl. 134, fig. 1).

Radial spines thin and long, cylindrical. The four meshes of each
equatorial and each polar plate of equal size, pentagonal, about eight
times as broad as the bars. By-spines zigzag, nearly as long as the radius.
In this species the hemihedral variety, _Hemiaspis_, often occurs.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.15, of the parmal pores 0.016.

_Habitat._--South-east Pacific (west coast of Patagonia), Station 302,
surface.


{835}2. _Dodecaspis trizonia_, n. sp.

Radial spines thin, cylindrical in the longer inner half, conical in the
shorter outer half. The four meshes of each equatorial and each polar plate
of equal size, roundish or nearly circular, five to six times as broad as
the bars. By-spines straight, denticulated, scarcely half as long as the
radius.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.12, of the parmal pores 0.012.

_Habitat._--South-west Pacific (east coast of New Zealand), Station 169,
surface.



B. Tribe II. #Lychnaspida#, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 467.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with twenty perforated plates or fenestrated
shields (each plate at least with four pores), produced by union of the
branches of the four crossed apophyses, which arise, opposite in pairs,
from each radial spine. The spherical shell is composed of the twenty
plates united by sutures (rarely by concrescence).



Genus 362. _Tessaraspis_,[402] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 468.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with twenty plates, which are perforated by
eighty aspinal pores (four crossed pores in each plate). Surface smooth,
without by-spines.

The genus _Tessaraspis_ introduces the series of Lychnaspida, which
comprise all those Dorataspida in which the shell is composed of twenty
plates, each of which is perforated by four primary aspinal pores. In
_Tessaraspis_ and _Lychnaspis_ each plate exhibits only these four primary
pores, whilst in _Icosaspis_ and _Hylaspis_ they become surrounded by a
circle of secondary or coronal pores. If in _Stauraspis_, the common
ancestral form of the Tessaraspida, the four crossed apophyses of each
single radial spine became recurved and united together, we should have the
typical plate of _Tessaraspis_, in which the piercing radial spine is
surrounded by four crossed pores of equal size. The number of sutural
pores, between the neighbouring plates, is variable; usually each plate is
surrounded by a circle of eight to twelve sutural pores. The sutures
between the meeting condyles of the apophyses usually remain open; but in
some species they become obliterated (subgenus _Tessaraspidium_).

on the highest point of the plates, the shell becomes polyhedral
(dodecahedral?).

exhibits the same structure of the shell as its ancestral form
_Tessaraspis_, and differs from it only in the development of by-spines on

most graceful and elegant of the Radiolaria.

13. _Lychnaspis rabbeana_, n. sp.

Parmal meshes circular, very small, of the same breadth as the bars, and
much smaller than the irregular sutural meshes. By-spines (about one
hundred) very long and thin, zigzag, about as long as the diameter of the
shell. Radial main-spines cylindrical, thick, twice to three times as long

smaller than the irregular sutural pores. By-spines zigzag, as long as the
diameter of the shell. Radial main-spines very thin and long,
needle-shaped, cylindrical, five to six times as long as the diameter of

Genus 364. _Icosaspis_,[404] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 468.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with twenty plates, which are perforated by
one hundred and sixty to three hundred or more parmal pores (in each plate
four crossed aspinal pores, and around them four to twelve or more coronal
pores). Surface without by-spines.

The genus _Icosaspis_ and the closely allied _Hylaspis_ differ from all
other Tessaraspida in the increased number of the parmal pores. Whilst this
number in all other genera is eighty (only four crossed pores in each
plate), here it amounts to one hundred and sixty to three hundred or more
(sometimes more than a thousand); in each shield four primary, crossed
"aspinal pores" being surrounded by a circle of four to twelve or more
"coronal pores." The number of sutural pores in these two genera is also
increased.



Subgenus 1. _Icosasparium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Condyles of the neighboring plates connected by permanent
open sutures; therefore the whole shell composed of twenty separated pieces
of acanthin.


1. _Icosaspis tabulata_, n. sp. (Pl. 136, fig. 2).

Parmal meshes all of nearly equal size and form, square, four times as
broad as the bars, little larger than the triangular or polygonal sutural
meshes.  In each plate fifty to seventy (regularly sixty-four) quadrangular
pores, viz., four primary square aspinal meshes, forming together a regular
square surrounded by two to three coronas of rectangular (not quite
regular) coronal meshes (six to eight in each transverse row). Radial
spines tetrapterous, prismatic, with four thin and broad wings, from which
arise the crossed bars between the four primary pores. Outer part of the
spines longer than the inner. Commonly the condyles of the plates are only
contiguous; sometimes they grow together, and this form approaches
_Icosaspis tetragonopa_.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.25 to 0.3, of the pores 0.02, bars
0.005.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 244, depth 2900 fathoms.


{844}2. _Icosaspis elegans_, n. sp. (Pl. 136, fig. 4; Pl. 134, fig. 9).

  _Tessaraspis elegans_, Haeckel, 1882, Manuscript et Atlas.

Parmal meshes of very different size and form; in the centre of each plate
a cross of four primary, pear-shaped "aspinal pores" (the largest of all);
between them four secondary, little smaller, crossed, egg-shaped "angular
pores"; around this rosette of eight larger meshes an inner complete circle
of sixteen to twenty polygonal coronal pores, and an outer incomplete
circle of thirty to forty very small marginal pores. The latter are smaller
than the irregular sutural meshes, which are constricted in the middle,
about forty to sixty around each plate. Radial spines thin, cylindrical, or
a little compressed; their outer part longer than the inner. In this
elegant and very common species the condyles usually remain separated by
sutures; but sometimes the latter become obliterated, and the whole shell
then forms a single piece, _Icosaspidium elegans_.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.2 to 0.3, commonly 0.25; larger
parmal pores 0.02, smaller 0.001 to 0.003; sutural pores 0.005 to 0.015;
bars 0.003.

_Habitat._--Tropical and Subtropical Atlantic, Canary Islands to Ascension
Island, Stations 340 to 354, surface.


3. _Icosaspis cruciata_, n. sp. (Pl. 134, fig. 10).

Parmal meshes very different; in the centre of each plate a cross of four
primary, nearly oblong, rectangular "aspinal pores"; between these four
secondary, triangular, egg-shaped "angular pores" (the largest of all), and
around this rosette a single circle of twelve to twenty-four small "coronal
pores." The latter are of about the same size as the irregular sutural
meshes, of which there are twenty to thirty around each plate. Radial
spines thin, cylindrical, or a little compressed; their outer part longer
than the inner.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.2 to 0.3, commonly 0.25; larger
parmal pores 0.025, smaller 0.005 to 0.01; bars 0.005.

_Habitat._--Tropical and Subtropical Pacific, Sandwich to Marquesas
Islands, Stations 256 to 274, surface.


4. _Icosaspis ornata_, n. sp.

Parmal meshes very different; in the centre of each plate a cross of four
primary octagonal aspinal pores (the largest of all); between them four
secondary, rhombic angular pores, and around this rosette a circle of
twelve to sixteen smaller, polyhedral coronal pores, which are however
larger than the irregular sutural pores (surrounding each plate to the
number of twenty to thirty). Radial spines thin, quadrangular, prismatic;
the outer part longer than the inner.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.25; larger parmal pores 0.03,
smaller 0.01; sutural pores 0.004 to 0.008; bars 0.006.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 295, depth 1500 fathoms.


{845}5. _Icosaspis spectabilis_, n. sp.

Parmal meshes very different; in the centre of each plate four very large,
pentagonal aspinal pores, and around these two to three circles of smaller
polygonal coronal pores, which are very numerous, and not larger than the
small sutural pores. Radial spines quadrangular, prismatic, stout, very
long; the outer part two to three times as long as the inner.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.4, of the larger aspinal meshes
0.03, of the outer meshes 0.002 to 0.02, bars 0.005.

_Habitat._--South Atlantic, Station 333, surface.


6. _Icosaspis multiforis_, n. sp.

Parmal meshes very numerous, more than one hundred in each plate; in the
centre four larger pear-shaped pores, and around these four to five circles
of smaller pores, gradually smaller towards the margin of the plate; the
sutural meshes also very small and numerous (more than fifty around each
plate), so that the number of all the pores together amounts to two
thousand or even more. Radial spines thin, cylindrical, very long.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.32; larger aspinal pores 0.02,
smaller 0.002 to 0.01; bars 0.003.

_Habitat._--Indian Ocean (Madagascar), Rabbe, surface.



Subgenus 2. _Icosaspidium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Condyles of the neighbouring plates grown together, and
sutures obliterated; therefore the whole shell forms a single piece of
acanthin.


7. _Icosaspis tetragonopa_, Haeckel.

  _Haliommatidium tetragonopum_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p.421,
  Taf. xxii. fig. 13.

Parmal meshes all of nearly equal size and form, square, three times as
broad as the bars, little larger than the sutural meshes. In each plate
commonly sixteen equal square meshes, viz., four primary aspinal and twelve
secondary, surrounding the former as a square corona. Radial spines
tetrapterous, stout; the outer pyramidal half somewhat longer than the
inner. This species differs from the similar _Icosaspis tabulata_ (Pl. 136,
fig. 2) in the concrescence of the sutures, the smaller number of pores,
and the form of the stouter spines. The figure in my Monograph, drawn from
a broken fragment, is not quite correct.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.18, pores 0.009, bars 0.003.

_Habitat._--Mediterranean (Messina, Corfu), surface.


8. _Icosaspis icosahedra_, n. sp.

Parmal meshes of different size and form; in the centre of each plate a
cross of four pentagonal, primary aspinal pores, surrounded by a complete
corona of twelve to sixteen polygonal coronal {846}pores and an incomplete
corona of thirty to forty very small marginal pores; the latter are not to
be distinguished from the pores of the obliterated sutures. Radial spines
quadrangular, the outer pyramidal part shorter than the inner prismatic
part. Condyles grown together. As the plates are quite even, the shell
becomes icosahedral.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.16, pores 0.002 to 0.02, bars 0.005.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 241, surface.

  _Tessaraspis icosastaura_, Haeckel, 1882, Manuscript et Atlas.

Parmal plates of different size and form; in the centre of each plate a
cross of four larger primary, pyriform aspinal pores; between these four
smaller roundish angular pores, and around this rosette a circle of ten to
twenty (commonly sixteen) coronal pores, little larger than the very small
sutural pores. Radial spines very thin and long, cylindrical or
bristle-shaped. Condyles grown together; no suture visible.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.14; larger pores of the cross 0.01,
smaller pores 0.002 to 0.008; bars 0.002 to 0.004.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 268, surface.



Genus 365. _Hylaspis_,[405] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Dorataspida# with twenty plates, which are perforated by
one hundred and sixty to three hundred or more parmal pores (in each plate
four crossed aspinal pores, and around them four to twelve or more coronal
pores). Surface covered with numerous by-spines.

The genus _Hylaspis_ exhibits the same structure of the shell as the nearly
allied ancestral genus _Icosaspis_, and differs from it only in the
development of by-spines. Some species of these two genera exhibit the
highest degree of complication in the structure of the shell seen among the
Dorataspida.


1. _Hylaspis serrulata_, n. sp. (Pl. 135, fig. 1).

Parmal meshes four hundred to five hundred; in the centre of each plate a
cross of four very large pentagonal or roundish aspinal pores, and around
this a circle of sixteen to twenty much smaller irregular, polygonal,
coronal pores; the latter of about the same size as the sutural pores. On
each condyle one thin zigzag-shaped by-spine, nearly as long as the radius.
Twenty radial spines very long, quadrangular, prismatic; on the inside
thinner and smooth, on the outside thickened, and armed with four rows of
recurved teeth, serrated.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.18, aspinal spines 0.02, other pores
0.002 to 0.01, bars 0.003.

{847}2. _Hylaspis coronata_, n. sp.

Parmal meshes five hundred to six hundred; in the centre of each plate a
cross of four long rectangular aspinal pores, between these four larger
egg-shaped angular pores; around this rosette a circle of sixteen to twenty
much smaller, irregular, roundish, coronal pores; the latter about of the
same size as the sutural pores. On each condyle one bearded by-spine about
one-third or one-fourth as long as the radius. Twenty radial spines, very
long, smooth, quadrangular, prismatic.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the shell 0.25, aspinal pores 0.02, other pores
0.005 to 0.01, bars 0.004.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.


3. _Hylaspis barbata_, n. sp.

Parmal meshes twelve hundred to sixteen hundred; in the centre of each
plate a cross of four large, somewhat oblong, octahedral aspinal pores,
between these four rhombic smaller angular pores; around this rosette an
inner circle of twelve to sixteen larger and an outer circle of fifty to
sixty very small coronal pores; the latter smaller than the sutural pores.
On each condyle one bristle-shaped zigzag by-spine, with recurved thin
hooks, half as long as the radius. Twenty radial spines, very long,
cylindrical, smooth.

Family XLI. #PHRACTOPELTIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 133, figs. 1-6).

_Phractopeltida_, Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 468.

_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with double spherical lattice-shell, composed of
the branched apophyses of twenty radial spines meeting in its centre, and
disposed according to the Müllerian law of Icosacantha. Central capsule
spherical, enclosing the inner and surrounded by the outer concentric
shell.

The family #Phractopeltida# differs from all other ACANTHARIA in the
development of a double spherical shell, composed of two concentric
lattice-spheres, which are united by twenty radial spines meeting in the
common centre. We could therefore oppose the Phractopeltida as
_Diplophracta_ to all other #Acanthophracta# as _Haplophracta_ (with simple
shell). The former exhibit a relation to the latter, similar to that
exhibited by the Dyosphærida to the simple Monosphærida among the
#Sphæroidea#.

In my Monograph (1862, p. 423) I described only one genus appertaining to
this family, _Aspidomma_. I founded it upon the singular _Phractopelta_,
described by {848}J. Müller as _Haliomma hystrix_. A second species of
_Aspidomma_, the _Acanthometra mucronata_ of J. Müller, was probably an
_Astrolonche_. At that time I placed _Aspidomma_ among the Haliommatida,
led by the erroneous opinion that it might represent a transition-form
between _Dorataspis_ and _Haliomma_. But I afterwards gave up this view, as
I was convinced that there is no true phylogenetic connection between the
acanthinic Dorataspida (_Actipylea_) and the siliceous Haliommatida
(_Peripylea_). Therefore in my Prodromus (1881, p. 468) I placed
_Aspidomma_ among the Dorataspida and changed its name to _Phractopelta_,
to avoid further confusion with the unrelated Ommatida (#Sphæroidea#). It
formed there, with three nearly related genera, the "subfamily
Phractopeltida," which we now advance to the higher rank of a separate
family. (By a typographical mistake the words are printed in the Prodromus
_Phractopelma_ and Phractopelmida, &c., instead of _Phractopelta_ and
Phractopeltida, &c.). The detection of other new species appertaining to
this family, and a closer anatomical investigation of them, has now led to
the distinction of five different genera, characterised by other
differences than were employed in 1881 in the provisional system of the
"Prodromus."

The two concentric spherical lattice-shells of the Phractopeltida,
connected by radial beams, correspond perfectly to those of the
double-shelled Dyosphærida (_Haliomma_, _Diplosphæra_, &c.), and in both
cases we may call the smaller inner the "medullary shell," and the larger
outer the "cortical shell." There is no doubt that the double-shelled
Phractopeltida must be derived phylogenetically from the simple-shelled
Dorataspida (just as we derive the double Dyosphærida from the simple
Monosphærida). But it is not yet possible to decide positively which of the
two shells is the first formed. Probably the small inner or medullary shell
of the Phractopeltida is the first formed, and corresponds to the simple
spherical lattice-shell of the Dorataspida; and the larger outer or
cortical shell of the former is a later new formation, absent in the latter
family. This opinion seems to be confirmed by the genus _Orophaspis_, the
only form among the Dorataspida, in which the radial spines outside the
shell bear free latticed apophyses. If these twenty apophyses grow further
and meet one another, the second or outer shell of _Phractopelta_ may be
formed. But some objections may be raised to this opinion from the peculiar
structure and the very small size of the inner shell; and there is some
possibility that this latter is a secondary later product inside of the
primary cortical shell. The probably phylogenetic series which reveals the
origin of the Phractopeltida is the following:--_Acanthometron_,
_Zygacantha_, _Lithophyllium_, _Phractacantha_, _Doracantha_, _Dorataspis_,
_Orophaspis_, _Phractopelta_.

The twenty radial spines exhibit in all Phractopeltida the same
characteristic position and relation as in all other Icosacantha, and are
constantly arranged according to the Müllerian law in four meridian planes,
their distal ends falling into five parallel zones. Their distinction in
the majority of the Phractopeltida is not difficult, {849}since the spines
of the different zones bear apophyses of different shapes. Sometimes the
four equatorial spines are stouter than the sixteen other spines, and often
the eight tropical spines are somewhat different in form from the eight
polar and from the four equatorial spines. The length of all twenty spines
is commonly equal. Their form is usually more or less compressed, two-edged
(as in _Zygacantha_), more rarely cylindrical (as in _Acanthometron_), or
somewhat quadrangular (but not truly prismatic); therefore the transverse
section of the spines is commonly elliptical or lanceolate, rarely circular
or rhombic, never square; this seems to indicate their origin from
_Zygacantha_. As in all ACANTHARIA, the spines consist of acanthin, not of
silex. Their central ends are either perfectly grown together, and form a
single star of acanthin, or the triangular faces of their small pyramidal
bases are supported one upon another, without true concrescence.

The apophyses of the radial spines, by which the two concentric spherical
shells are formed, seem to be constantly four on each spine, two being
opposite in each shell. The proximal pair of opposite apophyses, forming
the inner or medullary shell, is constantly much smaller than the distal
pair composing the outer or cortical shell (Pl. 133, fig. 5). The proximal
pair corresponds probably to the two primary apophyses of the Diporaspida
(_Phractaspis_, _Dorataspis_, &c.), whilst the distal pair corresponds to
the free apophyses of _Orophaspis_ (Pl. 133, fig. 6). Therefore the
Phractopeltida may be derived phylogenetically from the Diporaspida (not
from the Tessaraspida). In the common ancestral genus of this family,
_Phractopelta_, the free part of the radial spines (outside the outer
shell) is quite simple, without free apophyses; in all other genera of the
family that free part of the spines (either in all twenty spines or only in
some of them) bears a third pair of lateral apophyses; these may be either
simple or branched or even latticed; but the outer apophyses (of the third
rank) remain constantly free, and a third lattice-shell is never formed by
union of their edges (Pl. 133, figs. 2-4).

The inner lattice-shell of the Phractopeltida, or their "medullary shell,"
is constantly very small (commonly 0.03 to 0.05 mm. in diameter, rarely
more). Its structure is difficult to make out; in the unbroken shell it is
concealed by the dense network of the outer shell; in the broken shell it
is commonly destroyed. Usually the pores of the inner shell are very small,
circular or subcircular, scarcely as broad as the small separating bars. In
the majority of Phractopeltida their number seems to be about forty, being
probably the forty primary aspinal pores of the Diporaspida; in some
species this number seems to be exceeded, so that perhaps some sutural
pores may exist between the aspinal pores; but commonly the twenty plates
composing the inner shell (each with two aspinal pores) seems to grow
together perfectly by their meeting edges, so that there are no sutural
pores between them. Evident sutures were not recognisable in the inner
shell of any Phractopeltida.

{850}The outer lattice-shell of the Phractopeltida, or their "cortical
shell," is at least twice as broad, commonly about three times as broad, as
the enclosed inner shell; it is much more varied in composition than the
latter. Like the greater part of the Dorataspida we may distinguish here in
the lattice-work two kinds of pores--parmal pores and sutural pores. The
parmal pores are produced by the union of the meeting branches of the
apophyses of each single spine, and are therefore visible on each isolated
spine; whilst the sutural pores are formed by the meeting branches of the
apophyses of neighbouring spines. The distinction of the parmal and the
sutural pores, easy in most Dorataspida, is difficult in most
Phractopeltida, because the sutures between the meeting branches are
usually very early obliterated. However, the place of the obliterated
suture is often indicated by the thickened condyles of the apophyses on
both sides of the suture. Commonly also the form of the sutural pores is
much more irregular than that of the parmal pores; the former are more or
less constricted in the middle by the intumescence of the sutural condyles,
whilst the latter are more roundish, elliptical, kidney-shaped, or square.
The number of the pores in the outer shell in the typical normal form of
Phractopeltida seems to be the same as in the most species of _Dorataspis_,
_Diporaspis_, &c., between ninety and one hundred, viz., forty parmal pores
and from fifty to sixty sutural pores. However, in many species this number
is increased. Since in all Phractopeltida, each of the twenty plates is
composed only of the meeting branches of two opposite apophyses, we find
originally in each plate only two primary parmal pores or "aspinal pores."
But in some species there occur four, six, or more pores in each plate; in
this case two of them only are aspinal pores, all the others being "coronal
pores." Moreover, in those species which exhibit on the base of each spine
in the outer shell four crossed pores (Pl. 133, fig. 2), there are not four
equivalent aspinal pores (as in the Tessaraspida), but the two opposite are
primary or aspinal pores and the other two (different from them in size and
form) coronal pores. However, the number of coronal pores in the
Phractopeltida is never so large as in many Dorataspida, and the same holds
good also for the increasing number of the irregular sutural pores. In none
of the species observed does the total number of the pores in the outer
shell reach two hundred.

The original mode of development of the apophyses composing the outer shell
seems to be imitated by the free apophyses of the third order, which are
developed from the radial spines outside the outer shell in all
Phractopeltida, with the single exception of the simple ancestral genus
_Phractopelta_. These apophyses of the third rank are also originally
constantly two, opposite to one another (after the type of _Lithophyllium_,
_Dorataspis_, &c.). Commonly they do not remain simple, but become
branched, and by communication of the neighbouring branches small
lattice-plates arise. Originally each of these free lattice-plates has only
two parmal pores, but the number of the parmal pores increases afterwards,
so that we  may distinguish two (primary) {851}aspinal pores, and two,
four, or more (secondary) coronal pores. In the majority of species the two
opposite apophyses are first crossed at right angles by a transverse beam,
and the two parallel transverse beams are again crossed by perpendicular
tertiary branches (again parallel to the apophyses). In this case the
network of the free lattice-plates becomes more or less rectangular. But in
other species the ramification of the apophyses assumes more the form of
bifurcation or of irregular branching. As already said, the neighbouring
free lattice-plates of this third order never meet, and therefore a
complete third shell is never formed.

The different genera of Phractopeltida exhibit very remarkable differences
in the development of free apophyses (or lattice-plates of the third
order). Whilst in the numerous species of the ancestral genus
_Phractopelta_ all twenty spines remain simple, without such apophyses,
only in a single observed species (representing the genus _Pantopelta_)
were all twenty spines protected by them. In the three other genera only
one part of the spines bears free apophyses, but not the other part. The
most frequent form is _Dorypelta_ (Pl. 133, fig. 2); here eight spines are
simple (four equatorial and four polar spines of the hydrotomical plane),
whilst twelve spines bear apophyses (eight tropical and four polar spines
of the geotomical plane). In _Octopelta_ the eight tropical spines only
bear apophyses, whilst the twelve other (four equatorial and eight polar)
are simple. In _Stauropelta_ finally the four equatorial spines only are
simple, whilst the sixteen other bear free apophyses (eight tropical and
eight polar spines).

_The Central Capsule_ of the Phractopeltida is constantly spherical, and
enclosed between the two concentric spherical shells; it is therefore
larger than the inner and smaller than the outer shell. Its wall is pierced
by the twenty radial beams connecting the two shells. The shape of the
central capsule and of the enveloping calymma is the same as in the other
#Acanthophracta# and specially in the Dorataspida.

{852}Genus 366. _Phractopelta_,[406] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 468.

_Definition._--#Phractopeltida# with twenty simple radial spines, bearing
no free apophyses outside the outer shell.

The genus _Phractopelta_ is the most simple form among the Phractopeltida,
and may be regarded as the common ancestral form of this family. All twenty
spines are of nearly equal form and size, and bear no free apophyses on
their free part, outside the two concentric shells. _Phractopelta_ may be
derived from _Orophaspis_ by further development of the free apophyses,
which by union of their branches form a second outer shell around the
primary shell of that Dorataspid.

_Definition._--#Phractopeltida# with twelve simple spines (four equatorial
and eight polar), and with eight tropical spines protected by external free
apophyses.

The genus _Octopelta_ differs from the other Phractopeltida in the
possession of eight shields or pairs of free apophyses outside the outer
lattice-shell; the spines bearing these apophyses are the eight tropical
spines. The twelve other spines (eight polar and four equatorial) are quite
simple, without apophyses.


1. _Octopelta cultella_, n. sp.

Apophyses of the eight tropical spines simple, compressed, knife-shaped,
about as long as their distance from the outer shell. On the base of each

is again crossed by two perpendicular branches; by union of these branches
each tropical spine forms a square shield with four crossed pores and

surface of the outer shell) four crossed aspinal pores which correspond to
those of the free shields; these are somewhat larger than the other pores.

_Dimensions._--Diameter of the outer shell 0.12, of the inner 0.06.

_Habitat._--Tropical Atlantic, Station 348, surface.



Genus 369. _Dorypelta_,[409] Haeckel, Prodromus, p. 369.

_Definition._--#Phractopeltida# with eight simple spines (four equatorial
and four hydrotomical polar spines) and with twelve spines protected by
external free apophyses (eight tropical and four geotomical polar spines).

The genus _Dorypelta_, the most common of all Phractopeltida which are
protected by free apophyses, exhibits a very peculiar differentiation of
its twenty radial spines. There are constantly eight simple spines and
twelve spines with apophyses. The eight simple spines are the four
equatorial spines and four polar spines placed in the hydrotomical median
plane. The four other polar spines (placed in the geotomical meridian
plane) and the eight tropical spines are protected by two opposite
apophyses, which are now simple, now branched or shield-shaped. A similar
differentiation occurs in no other Acanthophractida.

Suborder II. PRUNOPHRACTA.

_Definition._--Shell ellipsoidal, lenticular or diploconical, with radial
beams of different size.



Family XLII. #BELONASPIDA#, n. fam. (Pl. 136, figs. 6-9; Pl. 139, figs. 8,
9).

_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with a simple ellipsoidal lattice-shell, composed
of the branched apophyses of twenty radial spines meeting in its centre and
disposed according to the Müllerian law of Icosacantha. Two opposite
equatorial spines larger than the two others. Central capsule ellipsoidal,
enclosed in the fenestrated shell.

The family #Belonaspida#, formerly united by me with the Dorataspida (in
the Prodromus, 1881, p. 468), differs from it in the ellipsoidal form of
the lattice-shell and {860}the enclosed central capsule. In the spherical
Dorataspida, their ancestral family, all twenty radial spines are of equal
size, whilst here in the Belonaspida two opposite spines are larger than
the eighteen others. These two larger or principal spines are both
equatorial spines, placed in the longitudinal or major axis of the
ellipsoid, or the "hydrotomical axis" (compare above, p. 719). The two
other equatorial spines are constantly smaller, and lie in the transverse
or minor axis of the ellipsoid, or the "geotomical axis." The geometrical
proportion of these two determining axes of the ellipsoidal shell is very
variable (even in one and the same species), commonly 4 : 3 or 3 : 2,
rarely 2 : 1, often only 5 : 4 or 6 : 5. All meridian planes, passing
through the principal spines (or the longitudinal axis of the shell) are
elliptical, and of equal size. All transverse planes, perpendicular to that
axis, are circular; the largest of these circular parallel planes is the
geotomical plane, which passes through the smaller equatorial spines and
the spineless axis.

In the spherical Dorataspida the internal length of the radial spines (or
the distance between the shell and the centre) is equal in all twenty
spines. In the ellipsoidal Belonaspida this internal length is different,
and commonly exhibits four different degrees; in the two principal spines
it is of first rank, in the eight tropical spines of second rank, in the
four (hydrotomical) polar spines of third rank, and in the six spines (four
geotomical polar spines and two transverse equatorial spines) of fourth
rank. These differences of the internal length become more important the
more the hydrotomical axis is prolonged. Regarding all other qualities (in
form, disposition, and mode of junction at the centre) the ellipsoidal
Belonaspida do not differ from their ancestral group, the spherical
Dorataspida (compare above, p. 802). In both families the pyramidal central
bases of the twenty spines are commonly supported one upon another with
their triangular neighbouring faces; but sometimes also here (particularly
in _Phatnaspis_) the central bases are perfectly grown together. In this
case also the sutures of the meeting branches of the apophyses are
obliterated, whilst usually they remain open. Such forms, with spines and
plates perfectly grown together, form a single piece of acanthin, and were
formerly separated by me as a peculiar genus _Haliommatidium_ (Monogr. d.
Radiol., 1862, p. 419). But as I now find this concrescence to be an
accidental and inconstant peculiarity of some species, it no longer seems
to me to be of generic importance.

The apophyses of the twenty radial spines, the branches of which compose
the ellipsoidal lattice-shell, exhibit in all Belonaspida the same
appearance as in the Diporaspida (and especially the Ceriaspida) among the
spherical Dorataspida. Everywhere each radial spine gives off only two
opposite primary apophyses, the fork-branches of which unite together and
form a plate or shield with two aspinal pores (as in _Dorataspis_).
Commonly the shell exhibits only these forty parmal pores, the other meshes
between them being sutural pores. Only in one genus, _Phatnaspis_ (Pl. 136,
{861}figs. 6-9), is this number multiplied; the two opposite primary
apophyses are here crossed by numerous perpendicular lateral branches, and
these are again united by secondary perpendicular ramules which are
parallel to the apophyses themselves; therefore each plate here forms a
rhombic shield pierced by very numerous (often more than one hundred) small
quadrangular or circular pores. Only two of these numerous parmal pores are
the primary aspinal pores (sometimes, as in Pl. 136, fig. 8, distinguished
by their larger size); all others are secondary or coronal pores. Therefore
_Phatnaspis_ repeats the characteristic formation of _Coscinaspis_, from
which it differs in its ellipsoidal shell.

Moreover, the four other genera of the ellipsoidal Belonaspida correspond
perfectly to certain genera of the spherical Dorataspida, and may be
derived from these by hypertrophy or stronger development of two opposite
equatorial spines. In _Thoracaspis_ and _Belonaspis_ (Pl. 139, figs. 8, 9)
the surface of the shell-plates is without crests and dimples (in the
former without, in the latter with accessory by-spines); they thus
correspond to _Dorataspis_ and _Diporaspis_ among the Dorataspida. In two
other genera the surface of the shell-plates bears a network of elevated
crests, separating funnel-shaped dimples, in _Dictyaspis_ without, in
_Coleaspis_ with by-spines; these correspond to _Ceriaspis_ and
_Hystrichaspis_ among the Dorataspida. The small by-spines, covering the
surface, exhibit the same forms as in the Dorataspida; but they are usually
smaller, and less developed in the Belonaspida.

The twenty radial spines are commonly more or less compressed or two-edged,
sometimes very flat, broad, and triangular (Pl. 139, figs. 8, 9). In some
species (mainly of _Phatnaspis_) they are very long, thin, and
needle-shaped (Monogr. d. Radiol., 1862, Taf. xxii. figs. 10-12). Rarely
they are cylindrical, four-edged, or prismatic. The Belonaspida testify by
this and other peculiarities to their near relation to the Diporaspida and
Phractacanthida and their older origin from _Zygacantha_.

_The Central Capsule_ is in the Belonaspida ellipsoidal, and more or less
prolonged in the hydrotomical or longitudinal axis of the shell. It is
constantly smaller than the enveloping ellipsoidal shell, and separated
from it by the calymma. Its structure and the shape of its nucleus are the
same as in the nearly allied Dorataspida.

without dimples and crests, also without by-spines, therefore with smooth
surface.

The genus _Thoracaspis_ is the simplest form among the Belonaspida, and
repeats in this family the nearly allied genus _Dorataspis_ among the
Dorataspida. It differs from this genus only in the characteristic
prolongation of one equatorial axis, which effects an ellipsoidal
transformation of the spherical central capsule and the enclosing
lattice-shell.


1. _Thoracaspis ellipsoides_, n. sp.

Parmal pores large, elliptical, five or six times as large as the small
circular sutural pores. Each plate surrounded by five or six sutural pores
(a single one on each side). Spines compressed triangular, sword-like,
two-edged; inner and outer half of nearly equal length.

_Dimensions._--Length of the ellipsoidal shell (or major axis) 0.15,
breadth (or minor axis) 0.12; length of the spines 0.07, basal breadth
0.016.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 253, surface.


2. _Thoracaspis nephropora_, n. sp.

Parmal pores large, kidney-shaped, three to four times as large as the
roundish small sutural pores. Each plate surrounded by five or six sutural
pores (a single one on each side). Spines in the inner longer part
cylindrical, in the outer shorter part conical, not compressed.

_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.2, breadth 0.15; length of the spines
0.06, basal breadth 0.018.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 268, surface.


3. _Thoracaspis circopora_, n. sp.

Parmal pores circular, of the same size as the circular sutural pores. Each
plate surrounded by five or six sutural pores (a single one on each side).
Spines compressed, thin, linear, two-edged; outer part one and a half times
as long as the inner.

_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.17, breadth 0.13; length of the spines
0.12, basal breadth 0.003.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 288, surface.


4. _Thoracaspis bipennis_, n. sp. (Pl. 139, fig. 8).

Parmal pores elliptical, about twice as large as the circular sutural
pores, which are of rather variable size. Each plate surrounded by eight to
twelve sutural pores (commonly two on each side). {863}Spines compressed,
triangular, gradually tapering towards both ends; outer half a little
longer, and much broader than the inner.

_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.14, breadth 0.12; length of the spines
0.08, basal breadth 0.025.

Genus 372. _Belonaspis_,[412] Haeckel, 1862, Prodromus, p. 468.

_Definition._--#Belonaspida# with forty parmal pores (two on each plate),
without dimples and crests, but with numerous by-spines on the surface.

The genus _Belonaspis_ differs from its ancestral genus _Thoracaspis_ only
in the possession of numerous superficial by-spines, and bears therefore to
it the same relation as _Diporaspis_ does to _Dorataspis_. The two latter
differ from the two former in the spherical form of the central capsule and
the enclosing shell, which here becomes ellipsoidal.


1. _Belonaspis pandanus_, n. sp.

Parmal pores elliptical, three or four times as large as the circular
sutural pores. Each plate surrounded by five or six sutural pores (a single
one on each side). Spines compressed, triangular; outer part half as long
as the inner, and twice as long as the numerous, simple, bristle-shaped
by-spines.

_Dimensions._--Length of the ellipsoidal shell (or major axis) 0.12,
breadth (or minor axis) 0.1; length of the spines 0.03, basal breadth 0.02.

_Habitat._--South Pacific, Station 295, surface.


2. _Belonaspis furcata_, n. sp.

of the shell; gradually tapering from its surface towards both ends.
By-spines very short and numerous, simple.

_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.13, breadth 0.11; length of the spines
0.08, basal breadth 0.025.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 271, surface.

circular pores. Each plate surrounded by ten to twelve sutural pores (two
on each side). Spines very thick, half as long in the outer conical part as
in the inner cylindrical part. By-spines very short, conical.

_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.2, breadth 0.16; length of the spines
0.05, basal breadth 0.03.

_Habitat._--Central Pacific, Station 267, surface.


6. _Belonaspis multiforis_, n. sp.

plate surrounded by fifteen to eighteen sutural pores (three on each side).
Spines compressed, about as long as the radius. By-spines very numerous,
zigzag, half as long as the radius.

_Dimensions._--Length of the shell 0.22, breadth 0.18; length of the spines

Genus 373. _Dictyaspis_,[413] n. gen.

_Definition._--#Belonaspida# with forty parmal pores (two on each plate),
without by-spines, but with a network of prominent crests on the dimply
surface.

The genus _Dictyaspis_ repeats among the Belonaspida the characteristic
structure of _Ceriaspis_ (among the Dorataspida), by the development of
prominent crests forming a {865}network with dimples on the outer surface
of the shields. Either all the dimples or only a part of them are pierced
by a pore. The forty aspinal pores are united in pairs in twenty larger
dimples. The shell is usually very thick-walled and non-transparent.

2. _Dictyaspis favosa_, n. sp.

Surface of the shell with one hundred and seventy to one hundred and ninety
deep funnel-shaped dimples, seventy to eighty of which are perforated, the
others blind; among the former each of the fifty to sixty smaller contains
a single sutural pore, each of the twenty larger a couple of aspinal pores.
All pores of nearly the same size. Outer part of the compressed two-edged
spines triangular, half as long as the inner part. Radius of the shell six
times as large as the thickness of its wall. (Differs from _Ceriaspis

0.04, basal breadth 0.025.

3. _Dictyaspis compacta_, n. sp.

Surface of the shell with one hundred and seventy to one hundred and ninety
deep funnel-shaped dimples, seventy to eighty of which are perforated, the
others blind; among the former each of fifty to sixty each contain a single

the same size, very deep. Outer part of the compressed sword-like spines
somewhat longer than the inner part. Radius of the dark shell only twice as
large as the thickness of its compact wall.

{866}Genus 374. _Coleaspis_,[414] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 468.

_Definition._--#Belonaspida# with forty parmal pores (two on each plate),
with numerous by-spines and with a network of prominent crests on the
dimpled surface.

The genus _Coleaspis_ differs from its ancestral genus _Dictyaspis_ in the
development of numerous by-spines, and bears therefore among the
ellipsoidal Belonaspida the same relation to it as _Hystrichaspis_ does to
_Coscinaspis_ among the spherical Dorataspida. If the four equatorial
spines in _Coleaspis_ become different in pairs, it passes over into
_Hexalaspis_. The shell is usually very dark and thick-walled.

radius of the shell, compressed, sword-like, two-edged; both equatorial
spines of the hydrotomical axis little longer than the eighteen others.
Crests between the dimples of the shell-surface dentated, forming around
the basal half of each spine a cylindrical sheath with a dentated,
crown-like mouth, the teeth of which are prolonged into simple by-spines.
(Similar to _Hexaconus coronatus_, Pl. 139, fig. 5, but differing in the
nearly equal size of the spines and their sheaths, and in the longer
by-spines.)

All twenty spines of nearly equal size and form, nearly as long as the
diameter of the shell, conical; both equatorial spines of the hydrotomical
axis about one-third longer than the eighteen others. Crests between the
dimples of the shell-surface serrated, forming around the basal half of
each spine a conical truncate sheath with crested surface and serrated
mouth, the teeth of which are prolonged into short by-spines. (Similar to
_Hexaconus vaginatus_, Pl. 139, fig. 7, but differing in the nearly equal
size of all the spines and in the double thickness of the shell-wall.)

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the shell 0.12, minor 0.1, length of the
spines 0.08, basal breadth 0.01.

_Habitat._--North Pacific, Station 253, surface.


3. _Coleaspis obscura_, n. sp.

long as the eighteen others. Shell very dark and thick walled, quite
opaque.

{867}_Dimensions._--Major axis of the shell 0.1, minor 0.08; length of the
spines 0.06, of their sheaths 0.04.

_Habitat._--Arctic Ocean, Greenland, Koch, surface.


4. _Coleaspis occulta_, n. sp.

All twenty spines of nearly equal size and form, quite concealed in their
long cylindrical sheaths, which are somewhat longer than the radius of the
shell, and armed on the truncated mouth with acute simple teeth; each
sheath deeply sulcated, apparently resulting from the concrescence of
numerous parallel leaf-shaped by-spines. Small shell very dark and
thick-walled, quite opaque.

_Dimensions._--Major axis of the shell 0.08, minor 0.06; length of the
spines and their sheaths 0.05 to 0.06.

_Habitat._--Antarctic Ocean (off Kerguelen), Station 159, surface.



Subgenus 2. _Coleaspidium_, Haeckel.

_Definition._--Both equatorial spines of the hydrotomical axis much larger
and of peculiar form, different from the eighteen other spines.


5. _Coleaspis amphilonche_, n. sp.

Both equatorial spines of the hydrotomical axis much longer than the
eighteen others, and of very different form; one and a half times as long
as the diameter of the shell, prismatic, with six prominent edges,
pyramidal at the distal point. The eighteen other spines triangular,
compressed, two-edged, scarcely as long as the radius of the thick-walled
shell. Pores of the shell irregular polygonal, separated by ciliated
crests, which bear simple by-spines (one-third as long as the radius).

larger spines 0.22, of the eighteen smaller 0.06 to 0.08; basal breadth of
the former 0.03, of the latter 0.008.

6. _Coleaspis hydrotomica_, n. sp. (Pl. 140, fig. 14).

Both equatorial spines of the hydrotomical axis much larger than the
eighteen others, and of very different form; about as long as the diameter
of the shell, in the basal half four-sided pyramidal, with four thick
prominent edges, in the middle part constricted, in the distal half
lanceolate, two-edged. Both equatorial spines of the geotomical axis of
similar form, but much smaller, scarcely one-third as long. The sixteen
other spines sword-like, thin, two-edged, about as long as the radius of
the thick-walled shell. Pores of the shell irregular roundish, separated by
high dentated crests, which bears zigzag by-spines (half as long as the
radius).

two larger spines 0.11, of the eighteen others 0.04 to 0.06; basal breadth

{868}Genus 375. _Phatnaspis_,[415] Haeckel, 1881, Prodromus, p. 468

_Definition._--#Belonaspida# with eighty to two thousand or more parmal
pores (four to one hundred or more on each plate), without by-spines on the
surface.

The genus _Phatnaspis_ corresponds to the spherical _Coscinaspis_ among the
Dorataspida, and differs from the other Belonaspida in the great number of
the parmal pores; whilst the four other preceding genera exhibit only two
opposite aspinal pores in the centre of each plate, in this there are
constantly numerous coronal pores in addition to these, and the plates
always possess the characteristic form of a wainscotted or panelled work,
with quadrangular meshes. The number of these parmal pores amounts in each
plate to from ten to twenty, often one hundred and twenty or more;
therefore the number of parmal pores in the whole shell amounts to two
thousand or more. Sometimes the pores are circular, but in this case too
they are surrounded by quadrangular frames. The quadrangles are sometimes
quite regular squares, sometimes more or less irregular. The thin and
fragile bars between the quadrangular pores form in each plate two peculiar
systems of parallel crests, which cross at right angles. Commonly the
parallel crests of one system (parallel to the major diameter of the
compressed radial spines) are equidistant, and pierce from one edge of the
plate to the opposite, whilst the parallel crests of the other system
(parallel to the minor diameter of the spines) are interrupted and at
different distances (Pl. 136, fig. 9); but in other species both crossed
systems are quite regular. In each plate there is one primary diagonal rib
(often stronger than the parallel crests) which connects the two opposite
corners of the rhomboidal plate. We can distinguish in this genus three
different subgenera: A. in _Phatnasparium_ the primary diagonal rib arises
from both flat sides of the compressed sword-like, radial spines; B. in
_Phatnasplenium_ from both sharp edges of them; C. in _Phatnaspidium_ two
crossed diagonal ribs arise from four edges of the spines (combination of A
and B). Therefore in the first subgenus (A) two primary aspinal pores are
placed opposite on the sharp edges of the spines, but in the second (B)
inversely on their flat sides; in the third (C) there are apparently four
primary aspinal pores, which are probably derived from B or A by division
of the two pores.

Family XLIII. #HEXALASPIDA#, n. fam. (Pl. 139).

_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with a simple discoidal or lenticular
lattice-shell, composed of the branched apophyses of twenty radial spines
meeting in the centre and disposed according to the Müllerian law of
Icosacantha. Six larger spines in the hydrotomical plane, prominent on the
margin of the circular or elliptical biconvex lens. Fourteen other spines
much smaller or rudimentary. Central capsule biconvex lenticular, enclosed
in the fenestrated shell.

The family #Hexalaspida# represents a new small, but very interesting group
of Acanthophracta, which differs from all others in the lentelliptical or
triaxial form of the lenticular lattice-shell, the margin of which bears
six larger spines placed in the hydrotomical plane (compare above, p. 719).
They may therefore be characterised shortly as "_Acanthophracta
lentelliptica_," with three different dimensive axes and six larger
marginal spines. A closer comparison with the other ACANTHARIA leaves no
doubt that the Hexalaspida must be derived from the Belonaspida by stronger
development of six radial spines placed in the hydrotomical plane, namely,
two equatorial and four associated polar spines; whilst the six spines of
the geotomical plane (perpendicular to the former) are much smaller; the
eight tropical spines are intermediate in size between the former and the
latter.

The geometrical fundamental form of the Hexalaspida (of the central capsule
as well as of the enclosing shell) is therefore lentelliptical, with three
different dimensive axes, and they exhibit among the ACANTHARIA a relation
to the spherical Dorataspida and the ellipsoidal Belonaspida similar to
that which the lentelliptical #Larcoidea# exhibit to the spherical
#Sphæroidea# and the ellipsoidal #Prunoidea# among the #Sphærellaria#
(compare above, p. 599). The largest of the three dimensive axes (which are
perpendicular to one another) is here the hydrotomical axis, the shortest,
on the contrary, the geotomical axis; the intermediate in size being the
spineless axis. The development of the whole body is strongest in the
hydrotomical meridian plane, in which the six principal spines are placed;
it is weakest in the geotomical plane, in which the six smallest spines are
placed; the eight tropical spines are intermediate in size between the
others. This peculiar development is illustrated by the figures of Pl. 139,
where the four equatorial spines are everywhere marked by _c_, the eight
tropical spines by _b_ and _d_, the eight polar spines by _a_ and _e_.

{873}Rarely the six hydrotomical or principal spines are of equal size, and
thus the margin of the shell may be quite circular or regularly hexagonal
(Pl. 139, figs. 1-3); the two equatorial spines of the hydrotomical plane
are usually larger than its four polar spines, and thus the margin of the
shell becomes more or less elliptical (Pl. 139, figs. 4-7). Usually (almost
constantly) these six larger spines are more or less compressed,
triangular, often very broad and flat; their two edges lie in the
hydrotomical plane. Their two flat surfaces are often furrowed, with
longitudinal ribs or crests converging towards the simple apex of the
spines.

The fourteen smaller spines are regularly disposed according to the
Müllerian law of Icosacantha on both convex sides of the lenticular shell;
they are not only smaller than the six principal spines, but often also of
different form, much thinner and shorter, sometimes needle-shaped. In the
genera _Hexonaspis_ and _Hexacolpus_ (Pl. 139, figs. 1, 2) only their inner
part (inside of the shell) is developed, whilst their outer part is quite
rudimentary and not prominent on the surface. Therefore these genera appear
to possess only six marginal spines externally.

_The Lenticular Shell_ itself offers in the Hexalaspida great difficulties
in the way of accurate study, as its wall is constantly very thick and
dark, often quite opaque and non-transparent. However, prolonged accurate
researches have convinced me that its structure is essentially the same as
in the Belonaspida and especially in the genera _Dictyaspis_ and
_Coleaspis_. As in these latter the twenty plates of the shell bear high
crests or combs on the outer surface, and by these funnel-shaped dimples
are separated. The network of these crests is more or less regular (Pl.
139, figs. 1-7). Around the base of each radial spine the shell is usually
elevated in the form of a conical or cylindrical sheath; the crests are
prolonged into the sheaths as longitudinal ribs, parallel to the spine or
convergent towards its apex. Whilst in _Hexalaspis_ and _Hexonaspis_ these
basal sheaths are not at all or but little prominent (Pl. 139, fig. 2; Pl.
140, fig. 16), in _Hexaconus_ and _Hexacolpus_ they envelop the basal half
(or even more) of the spines, and very often the circular or elliptical
free distal edge of the sheath is elegantly denticulated or serrated  (Pl.
139, figs. 1, 3-7; pl. 140, figs. 9-16).

_The Pores_ of the shell exhibit in the Hexalaspida the same shape as in
the majority of the Belonaspida. Each spine bears only two broad opposite
apophyses, the fork-branches of which unite to form a polygonal shield with
two pores. The number of parmal pores is constantly (?) forty, as each
plate possesses only two primary aspinal pores; there are no secondary or
coronal pores. The numerous (between fifty and one hundred, rarely more)
smaller pores between the forty parmal pores are probably always sutural
pores; however, their number and position is very difficult to determine,
on account of the high protecting crests; the majority of the funnel-shaped
dimples between the latter seem to be blind, not perforated. Sometimes all
the dimples, except the twenty spinal ones, seem to be blind and the
sutural pores appear {874}to have disappeared completely, so that there
remain only twenty aspinal pores (Pl. 139, fig. 4).

The internal cavity of the shell in all Hexalaspida is very small, on
account of the thickness of the massive wall; the latter is often greater
than the diameter of the cavity. Setting aside this disproportion, the
space of the cavity is further much reduced by the internal parts of the
thick radial spines, which are united in the centre by their pyramidal
bases (Pl. 140, fig. 15). Usually the twenty bases seem to remain free
(supported one upon another by means of their triangular faces); but
sometimes they seem to grow together perfectly and to form a single central
star of acanthin. In some species, too, the sutures of the meeting branches
of the apophyses of neighbouring spines seem to grow together, so that the
whole shell exhibits a single piece of acanthin.

_The Central Capsule_ of the Hexalaspida is therefore very small and seems
to fill up the greatest part of the shell-cavity. Its form is constantly
more or less lenticular, sometimes lentelliptical. On account of the
opacity of the shell I could not make out its shape more closely.

Family XLIV. #DIPLOCONIDA#, Haeckel (Pl. 140).

_Diploconida_, Haeckel, 1862, Monogr. d. Radiol., p.404.

_Definition._--ACANTHARIA with simple diploconical shell, composed of two
very large equatorial spines which are opposite in the hydrotomical axis,
are surrounded by conical or cylindrical, often compressed sheaths, and
arise from a small central {882}lattice-shell. Eighteen other spines
(disposed according to the Müllerian law of Icosacantha) much smaller,
often rudimentary. Central capsule ellipsoidal or diploconical.

The family #Diploconida#, founded by me in 1862 for a single Mediterranean
species (_Diploconus fasces_), appears to be the most aberrant and strange
form among the ACANTHARIA. As I had met with only a single specimen, very
dark and intransparent in its central part, my observations on its
structure were imperfect and the explanation of it partly erroneous
(compare my Monograph, pp. 46, 404, Taf. xx. figs. 7, 8). However, I
regarded _Diploconus_ as the representative of quite a peculiar family,
derived from the Acanthometrida, and I correctly compared the large
opposite radial spines of one equatorial axis with the corresponding parts
in _Amphilonche_.

Afterwards Richard Hertwig observed some specimens of _Diploconus fasces_
in the same locality (Messina), and gave an accurate description of its
central capsule, including numerous small nuclei (1879, Organismus d.
Radiol., p. 28, Taf. ii. fig. 3). He found also that the peculiar
diploconical skeleton is not composed of silex, but of acanthin. In the
explanation of the shell-structure he adopted my opinion.

In the rich collections of the Challenger I detected ten different forms of
Diploconida, all very rare, and for the most part represented only by
single specimens. A twelfth species was found by me in the collection of
Captain Rabbe from the Indian Ocean. By the study of these new forms, and
particularly by their comparison with the most nearly allied Hexalaspida
and Belonaspida, it was possible for me to correct some errors in my former
description and to give a much more correct description and natural
explanation of this very peculiar and strange family of Radiolaria (compare
Pl. 140).

The most characteristic and the most voluminous part of the acanthinic
skeleton in all Diploconida appears as the diploconical or nearly
cylindrical solid "mantle" giving them their name and odd appearance (Pl.
140). Usually this mantle is broader on its two opposite terminal openings
than in its more or less constricted middle part. This latter is now more
spherical or ellipsoidal, now more lenticular, and usually separated from
the two cones by two slight transverse strictures. On the surface of this
middle part twelve to eighteen radial spines, which in _Diplocolpus_ are
rudimentary or absent, are visible in _Diploconus_. The longitudinal axis
of this shell is constantly occupied by a very large pair of opposite stout
prismatic or cylindrical principal spines, which are united in the centre
and usually more or less prominent with their distal apex over the two
openings of the double cone.

In my first communication on the _Diploconus_ (1862, _loc. cit._) I
correctly compared these two large spines in the prolonged main axis of the
shell to the principal equatorial spines of _Amphilonche_ (or to the
"hydrotomical spines," _c_1, _c_3); but my explanation of the two peculiar
cones enveloping them was erroneous. I supposed at that time that they were
formed by the eight flattened and leaf-shaped curved {883}tropical spines,
so that around each principal spine the four neighbouring tropical spines
(two of the northern and two of the southern hemisphere) had grow together
by their edges and formed the peculiar conical sheath. I can now say that
this opinion (afterwards adopted also by Hertwig) was quite erroneous, the
two conical or funnel-shaped sheaths being the enlarged basal sheaths of
the two hydrotomical spines, which we have already seen in the Hexalaspida
(Pl. 139). But whilst in these latter all six principal spines of the
hydrotomical meridian plane are hypertrophied (two equatorial and four
polar spines), in the nearly allied Diploconida only the two opposite
equatorial spines are developed, whilst all other eighteen spines are more
or less atrophied or quite rudimentary. In _Diploconus_ the latter are more
or less evident, whilst in _Diplocolpus_ they disappear externally.

The true lattice-shell of the #Acanthophracta# (constantly composed of the
meeting apophyses of twenty radial spines) is therefore represented in the
Diploconida by the small roundish middle part of the whole shell, which is
usually much smaller than the two opposite cones, and separated from them
by the two slight transverse strictures. Usually this small but most
important middle part of the shell is very dark and opaque, on account of
its very thick wall and small pores; but in some species it is clear enough
to ascertain that the structure of this lattice-shell is the same as in the
lenticular Hexalaspida, there being a network of thick crests on the outer
surface and small pores in the dimples between them. Indeed, in many (and
probably in all) Diploconida the forty aspinal pores are present which we
found in all Hexalaspida, Belonaspida, and Diporaspida, so that these four
families of #Acanthophracta# represent one continuous phylogenetical
series; _Phractaspis_ among the Diporaspida is at the beginning, and
_Diplocolpus_ among the Diploconida at the end of this remarkably
transformed morphological series.

The twenty radial spines in all Diploconida are probably united very firmly
(or even perfectly grown together) in the centre of the small thick-walled
lattice-shell, the inner space of which is extremely reduced. Probably,
too, the sutures between the meeting apophyses of the thick radial spines
are often (or even constantly) obliterated by concrescence, so that the
whole shell forms a single piece of acanthin. But I regret that I cannot
ascertain these and other points in the structure of the shell, as the
small number of specimens observed did not permit an anatomical examination
to be made. I have no doubt, however, that the structure of the whole of
the middle main part of the shell is quite the same as in the lenticular
shell of the thick-walled Hexalaspida, and that in both families each of
the twenty radial spines bears originally only two opposite apophyses.

The characteristic mantle of the double cone of the Diploconida, or the
basal sheath of their two large, perfectly developed principal spines is
usually much larger than the shell itself, and more or less compressed from
both poles of the shortened geotomical axis. Therefore the transverse
section of the two cones is usually elliptical, more {884}rarely circular.
Their widest part is generally the distal opening; more rarely this is a
little constricted. The thin transparent lamella of acanthin, representing
the mantle of the double cone, is commonly ribbed or furrowed by
longitudinal, parallel or divergent crests, and elegantly denticulated on
the edge of the distal opening.

The two conical or cylindrical halves of the mantle are connected with the
two enclosed principal spines not only at the base, where they arise from
the small central lattice-shell, but also throughout a certain part of
their length, by means of two, four, or six wings or leaves, which lie
opposite and in pairs in the meridian planes of those spines. These
meridian wings are more or less triangular (with broader concave outer
bases), and connected by their axial edge with the spine and by their
peripheral edge with the mantle. They separate two, four, or six conical
spaces or pyramidal compartments in each cone. But these aspinal
compartments and the separating septa are not new productions of the
Diploconida, but are inherited from their ancestral family, the Hexalaspida
(compare above, p. 873).

The eighteen smaller spines in _Diploconus_ are either of nearly equal size
or more or less differentiated. The eight tropical spines are often much
larger than the eight polar spines. The two geotomical spines, (or the two
opposite equatorial spines of the shortened geotomical axis) are often
quite rudimentary. In _Diplocolpus_ the external part (outside the shell)
is in all eighteen smaller spines rudimentary or atrophied.

_The Central Capsule_, as shown by Hertwig, contains numerous small nuclei,
and is divided into three parts by the above named two transverse
strictures; the smaller central part (in the original lenticular
lattice-shell) and the two opposite larger parts, filling up the greater
part of the two conical or cylindrical sheaths, and more or less adopting
their form. Corresponding to the shell itself the enclosed capsule is often
more or less flattened, being compressed at both poles of the geotomical
axis. The pseudopodia seem to proceed only from the two large polar
apertures of the sheaths, and form therefore two opposite conical tufts or
bunches.

and usually devoid of prominent sheaths. Sometimes the eight tropical
spines are rudimentary.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
